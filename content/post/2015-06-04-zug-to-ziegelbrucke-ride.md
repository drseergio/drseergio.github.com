On a Saturday two weeks ago I went on a bike ride from Zug to Ziegelbrucke through Einsideln and Pfaffikon. I was pretty familiar with many parts of the route.

I have experimented with Microsoft's Hyperlapse Pro software that renders video footage into fast-paced but stable fly-throughs. I am thoroughly impressed with the results and I plan to use it in future biking and hiking trips:

A scenic view on Pfaffikon, Rapperswil and the surrounding areas:

I have never biked or walked along the Obersee (the smaller lake linked to Zurich lake on the East side) so I was delighted by the nice unpaved road along the Northern side of the lake as well as pretty views to the local peaks:
