title: Three wonderful bike rides
---

2017 has been a wonderful year for cycling: regular club rides, a bike tour along Rhone river and to Cannes (to be shared later), riding in [Gran Canaria](/blog/2017/07/02/cycling-in-gran-canaria/) and many worthwhile local rides in Switzerland.

The fall has been a scenic gift. No other season is as attractive as the fall in Switzerland. It's full of colors and the dry weather is pleasant for riding.<!--more-->

Before I've assembled [Fargo bike](/blog/2015/09/03/salsa-fargo-rohloff/) for the first time (it had suspension and a derailleur system back then!) in fall of 2014 I haven't actually ridden that much.

As I got the bike together I went for the steepest rides for as long as I could, seeing firsthand just how beautiful autumn in Switzerland is. That one bike has significantly increased my yearly distances.

Not every ride is a bliss. I regularly find myself feeling miserable or being "elsewhere" during rides. I don't pretend that cycling is always a magical joyous experience. However, this fall has been prolific for outstanding rides. I treated every ride as the last one because the winter was very close and the mountain passes could have closed any day due to snow.

## Grosse Scheidegg (83.5km 1579m)

A recommendation and one of the most stunning bike rides in my life! The scenery had everything from autumn landscapes to freezing lakes and glaciers.

## Nufenenpass (87.9km 1806m)

Eventually I will ride over most mountain passes in Switzerland and Nufenenpass is the highest of them all! The more passes I ride over the harder it is to do the remaining ones because not every pass is conveniently reachable by public transport.

## Entlebuch (85.8km 1485m)

Another recommendation. The ride went through Entlebuch national reserve not far from Luzern. I enjoyed the later part of the ascent but the weather was a bit dull and I came down sick shortly after the ride.

## Up next

I will keep riding throughout the winter. In addition to the regular club rides and [indoor training rides](/blog/2016/05/28/indoor-cycling-lab/) I intend to keep doing short local rides. Above all, I hope to try out snow biking in some of the nearby parks. Last time I tried I felt disappointed.
