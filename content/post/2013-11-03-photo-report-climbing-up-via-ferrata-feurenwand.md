Via ferratas come in different difficulty levels. Last week I've done a K2 climb. Yesterday I went to Fuerenalp along with two friends and did a K4 climb. The route is a lot more exciting. Wet and slippery stones and supports presented an additional challenge.

According the alpine log book there were no other climbers that day.
