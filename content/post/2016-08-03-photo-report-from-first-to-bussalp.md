This week we went to the Grindelwald area for hiking. Getting there wasn't easy -- a relatively long 4-hour train journey each way plus additional delays due to an accident on the tracks. The accidents seem to become common as the same happened the week before. Anyhow, Grindelwald is vast with hiking routes. I've been to Grindelwald several times before and even stayed overnight once. Our hike wasn't difficult but very pretty.

Day's track on Strava: [https://www.strava.com/activities/662251820](https://www.strava.com/activities/662251820)

*Total distance walked*: 9.6km

*Vertical ascent*: 440m

*Total time*: 3:35:00

The area is quite popular with tourists and especially so on a weekend. Most tourists, though, don't venture too far away from the cable car.

At first we were greeted by friendly cows and mountain goats:

Then we arrived at the beautiful Bachsee lake:

From the lake we went higher...

and higher...

still higher...

Until we climbed over a ridge and began a descent to Bussalp:

The descent was accompanied by drizzling rain and piercing cold wind. We didn't have windproof jackets with us (or any jackets, for that matter) so we caught mild cold in the coming days. However, we were not disappointed with food [like the week before](/blog/2016/07/20/photo-report-silent-nanztal-valley-crossing/) -- proper mountain Rösti and our favorite Möhl drink.
