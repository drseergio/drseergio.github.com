  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past Sunday I hiked a fantastic route together with my wife. It&rsquo;s the first real hike this year and given the busy times it&rsquo;s unsurprising. But it wasn&rsquo;t just the first of a season. It was the most difficult hike my wife has ever completed and I was left totally impressed with her pace and endurance. Not only we walked for more than 15 kilometers but we also climbed almost a thousand vertical meters. For my wife, who normally prefers flat walks along ridges or lakes, it is a considerable accomplishment.</p>

<p>Day&rsquo;s track on Strava: <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/645364892">https://www.strava.com/activities/645364892</a></p>

<p>Inspiration: <a href="http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/silent-nanztal-valley-crossing.html">myswitzerland.com</a></p>

<p><em>Total distance walked</em>: 14.7km</p>

<p><em>Vertical ascent</em>: 968m</p>

<p><em>Total time</em>: 5:35:00</p>

<p>The day started early as we had to make it to one of the most remote places relative to our home. All in all, about 4 hours of public transport to get there. For me it&rsquo;s the second weekend in a row of visiting canton Valais. There was an accident on the train tracks along the route so our arrival was delayed for about an hour which made us understandably cautious given that our way back depended on a chair lift and chair lifts don&rsquo;t run 24/7. Still we sticked to the original plan and started walking.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27778716403"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8896/27778716403_ef72bbbe0e.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>It was scorching hot almost everywhere in Switzerland. One of the benefits of staying at higher altitudes is the cooler weather. There was a pleasant breeze throughout the route.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28112075750"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7775/28112075750_9dac6cbea9.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>Despite the numerous hikes I am still amazed at the scale and the magnificence of mountain landscapes. My mind simply can&rsquo;t grasp the distances. It needs something to put the size into perspective. Nothing gives a better sense than a huge panoramic shot with a tiny human silhouette somewhere in the picture.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28394972325"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8791/28394972325_76349c7ed7_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>For the first time ever we brought trekking poles with us. They were a real boon for my wife. Sadly I&rsquo;ve got none of that as we own just one pair. The poles provided significant support on the way up as well as on the way down. I see now that trekking poles allow us to take more challenging routes. The tactical advantage also evens out our walking paces. Perhaps we could rely on the same strategy for future difficult hikes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28290462142"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8718/28290462142_54c8aa0547.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27778755273"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8595/27778755273_2ac31ec0e2_z.jpg" width="427"></a></p>

<p>Closer to the end of the hike we stumbled into a herd of cows.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28290496852"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8176/28290496852_10f6070427.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I dislike walking fast. When I was much younger I had a tendency to walk so fast that I almost ran. It took me years of deliberate practice to get away from it. It feels great to walk slow and to contemplate the present instead of racing towards yet another passing thing. Still, it&rsquo;s important to keep planned estimates and actual walking speeds in mind. Astonishingly, we have finished quicker than the official signposts suggested! For our dynamic duo it&rsquo;s a remarkable achievement given that we normally arrive 1-2 hours later than any kind of estimate.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28112148850"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8877/28112148850_633a7a517b_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>The arrival at the chair lift was disappointing to say the least. We were looking forward to eat a typical mountain Rosti but the kitchen in the restaurant at the lift was already closed. We had no other choice but to scout for food upon descending into the valley. In any case, it was yet another great day in the mountains!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have purchased the Cube Cross Disc bicycle second-hand back in 2014 as an ultimate do-it-all machine to replace somewhat petite <a href="/blog/2014/01/02/6-months-on-a-bike/">BMC hybrid bike</a> I had started cycling on. No other bike in my stable went through as many alterations as the venerable Cube, transitioning from an object of admiration to almost scrap and most recently getting resurrected to fulfill a pragmatic new purpose. It was the bike I rode during the <a href="/blog/2014/12/03/what-i-learned-from-a-10-day-bicycle-tour/">legendary Rhine tour</a>. Perhaps it is also the bike I&rsquo;ve learned most of the bike mechanic skills on.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27799786284"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8682/27799786284_5b8f05055e_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27800895753"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8268/27800895753_4dabb15424_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>Originally intended as a noble cause to minimize the number of bikes I own the project turned into an ugly obsession to combine the most exotic parts in a wild chase to build the perfect bike. Following the purchase I stripped the bike to the frame and <a href="/blog/2014/05/26/cyclo-cross-bicycle-build-part-3/">rebuilt it with custom chosen components</a>. Barely finishing the Rhine tour I went into another frenzy, adding and replacing a good chunk of parts again. A disaster happened one evening when I was fiddling with the bottom bracket. Being distracted by a conversation I have inadvertendly destroyed the thread where the bottom bracket is screwed in. Very often that&rsquo;s the death of the bike frame. And at the time I assumed the bike was gone. I took it apart and, eschewing the faux minimalism, purchased the marvelous <a href="/blog/2015/09/03/salsa-fargo-rohloff/">Fargo</a> touring bike and the <a href="/blog/2015/06/11/twenty-first-century-ride/">BMC road bike</a> I&rsquo;m currently training on. The experience taught me a good lesson about minimalism. It is not always rational, nor cost effective, nor even meaningful. In pursuit of a do-it-all bike I&rsquo;ve ruined the bike by squeezing too much into it. There were panniers&hellip; and aerobars. A lot of parts were installed simply because of hype. Months later, when I brought the destroyed frame to a local bike shop I didn&rsquo;t expect the fatal mistake to get fixed. But it was! The mechanics were able to get the threads rechased. Not knowing what to do with the sudden fortune I left the frame to marinate in the cellar.</p>

<p>Until one day it occurred to me that I have accumulated so many spare bike parts from all the upgrades and replacements that I could probably rebuild the Cube without purchasing much. I also didn&rsquo;t have a city bike that could be left at train stations and public places without too much worry. With the priorities clear I decided to move forward with the rebuild. The priorities were: cheap (as few new parts as possible), disposable (no high-end components) and safe to leave. I am happy to report that I&rsquo;ve been riding this workhorse for more than half a year. It is not sleek nor glitzy but it&rsquo;s a pleasure to use everytime I&rsquo;m off to the swimming pool or to run an errand. I would like to share a couple technical challenges along the way as well as few cool things I came across when putting it all together.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28134119330"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8462/28134119330_605b8e76be.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>Guided by the cost I built the drivetrain with a combination of Shimano Zee and Shimano XT components. This being an errand bike I chose to forego the front derailleur and use 10 speeds in the rear for simplicity&rsquo;s sake. The gear range was nicely extended by a spare Wolf Tooth Components 42t sprocket I had. That&rsquo;s how many of the components ended up on the bike &ndash; I simply had them already. The 1x10 system didn&rsquo;t work flawlessly though and I have done lots of small changes to make the chain slide smoothly. The underlying issue was the chainline &mdash; the chain was too skewed in the largest rear sprocket. One could feel the tension. The front sprocket sat too far from the middle, relative to the cassette. That meant that smallest sprockets worked well but anything in the upper middle didn&rsquo;t. Getting the chainline right took many iterations.</p>

<p>At first I moved the bottom bracket spacers from the drive side to non-drive side. A free and noticeable improvement. Next, I have replaced a part of the Shimano XT derailleur with something called a <a href="http://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/products/goatlink">GoatLink</a>. I am not completely sure it made a big difference. The derailleur itself is quite important for the 1x10 drivetrains &mdash; it should be equipped with a clutch mechanism. I&rsquo;m personally using Shimano RD-M786. The final step was to install chainring spacers. That required longer chainring bolts and appropriate spacers. I found it somewhat difficult to track these parts. I found the fitting bolts on CRC although their original purpose seems different: <a href="http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/ch/en/race-face-poly-bashguard-fastener-bolt-kit/rp-prod46947">Race Face Poly Bashguard Fastener Bolt Kit</a>. The spacers must have inner diameter of 10mm. I found those at <a href="http://www.oneupcomponents.com/products/spacer-chainring-10mm-id-4-pack">OneUp</a>. Most recently I replaced the stock 36t Zee chainring with a 38t one. All in all, it works well enough now. I look forward to a time when internal gearboxes, such as the brilliant <a href="http://pinion.eu/en/">pinion</a>, become more widespread and affordable.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28383845426"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8619/28383845426_bb078fb0da.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The rest of the bike was put together similarly. The wheels are the cheapest 29&#8221; wheelset I could find on the market at 120 eur for a pair. Similarly, the saddle was only 20 eur. When any of these cheap parts gets stolen I&rsquo;ll just replace them with equally inexpensive alternatives. Knowing that I&rsquo;m going to leave the bike in public spaces I equipped the bike with a few theft deterrents. The first obvious deterrent was a heavy lock. I didn&rsquo;t spare cash on the lock. In fact, it might be the most expensive part of the bike. Secondly, I splurged for a set of Pitlock parts: skewers, stem bolt and the seat post collar bolt. Basically, Pitlock replaces standard skewers and bolts with specially shaped ones that require one of 256 individually-shaped locking tools, called &ldquo;Pits&rdquo;. Here&rsquo;s a visual demonstration how these Pitlock parts look like (front skewer, rear skewer, stem cap):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27799822554"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8834/27799822554_4ef7630a54_m.jpg" width="240"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28383884506"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8620/28383884506_ee0db673a1_m.jpg" width="240"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27800915953"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8618/27800915953_3472fd2b3e_m.jpg" width="240"></a></p>

<p>At the moment the bike has no original parts left except the frame and the headset. It may be the only Cube Cross Disc in the world with such a long history. Here&rsquo;s the complete list of parts from the build:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am not a peak collector by any stretch of imagination. Indeed I avoid &ldquo;the best&rdquo; like plague. I leave &ldquo;the best&rdquo; for the unsuspecting tourist crowds and boastful blabbers. But the fact is that I&rsquo;ve climbed to the highest altitude in my life. And I&rsquo;ve already paid my dues by feeling the wrath of Gods &mdash; reaching the peak left me untouched and the corresponding up-and-down motions were anything but mindful. Yet the purpose of this 2-day mountaineering trip has been fulfilled &mdash; I am now <em>formally</em> skilled in the basic skills of alpine walking and climbing.</p>

<p>Ever since my <a href="/blog/2015/07/10/mountaineering-in-valais/">first true alpine adventure last year</a> the pasture of trekking mountains and glaciers attracted me. I have not gone crazy about it and I don&rsquo;t currently have ambitions to get exceedingly great at it. Instead, hiking and mountaineering remain for me a gateway into a state of mind where little matters beyond what&rsquo;s immediately in front of me. I don&rsquo;t care about having the best gear. I also don&rsquo;t care about perceived challenge of this or that route. And I&rsquo;m definitely not going to train for it, say, by attending a climbing wall regularly.</p>

<p>With that said when I saw an opportunity to attend a 2-day mountaineering tour at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SwissAlpineAdventure/">SwissAlpineAdventure</a> aimed at educating beginners I couldn&rsquo;t pass. A little bit of structured knowledge and training couldn&rsquo;t hurt. The tour brought me back to region of Valais. Our starting point was the town of Saas Fe. The planned itinerary was not difficult. The goal of the first day was to get acquainted with the basics in a sandbox environment and then ascend Allalinhorn (4027m) the following day.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28184032622"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8741/28184032622_23699b3cbf_m.jpg" width="240"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27672040364"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8688/27672040364_482b6ed4b2_m.jpg" width="240"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28184048972"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8745/28184048972_a7d3ce3ec7_m.jpg" width="240"></a></p>

<p>This is how our movements looked like:</p>

<li>Day 1 track: <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/642367091">https://www.strava.com/activities/642367091</a></li>
<li>Day 2 track: <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/642368714">https://www.strava.com/activities/642368714</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Our schedule was generous with late starts, plenty of idle time and lots of help from lifts and cable cars. We didn&rsquo;t come up all the way from the valley. Instead we arrived by cable car to Felskinn station (3000m):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27672071334"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7313/27672071334_89dbebae5b_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>The way from the station to the <a href="http://www.britannia.ch/">Britannia hut</a> (3030m) was a short and mild stretch of slushing through snow. Our guide from <a href="http://www.bergundtal.ch/">bergundtal</a> Stephane Tuni engaged us regularly by educating about the hiding dangers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27672389023"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8597/27672389023_93b0741595.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a baby peak Klein Allalin (3070m) opposite the Britannia hut which we have used throughout the first day to practice. We learned how to correctly hold the axe, how to tie the ropes and how to safely walk with crampons.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28209634331"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8576/28209634331_6e4a49b05d.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The views from Klein Allalin are grand:</p>

<p>Seeing Ilya on this tour was a true serendipitous encounter. We haven&rsquo;t coordinated our participation. It just happened by chance. Ilya rightly complained about a recent trip to our beloved outdoor gear shop Transa and how much it cost him. I can relate easily as I&rsquo;ve done that trip last year. Right now I&rsquo;m all set with the gear.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28184107462"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8671/28184107462_8d34f89268.jpg" width="333"></a></p>

<p>The Britannia hut is relatively large and quite modern. I admit I&rsquo;m spoiled by great huts. Last year&rsquo;s trek was accompanied by huts that were as good and as modern. The hut is situated close to the cable-car station so it attracts a lot of visitors, especially during a weekend. It feels more like a hostel that just happpened to be in mountains. It was packed.</p>

<p>Knowing that I wouldn&rsquo;t fall asleep easily I decided to take a tripod with me and stay on Klein Allalinhorn until it gets dark to see the stars. The sky was relatively clear.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28288171755"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8862/28288171755_3c9cc512a8_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27672137354"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7704/27672137354_ef13a732b7_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I did not stay long enough to make worthwhile pictures of a starry night but I enjoyed the sight myself. Fantastic. When the complete darkness fell upon the mountains I felt a bit uncomfortable. Movements behind my back stirred alertness. A running marmot was the final drop on my nerves so I decided to get back to the hut and sit on a bench, marvelling at the sight.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28288177805"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8598/28288177805_472acd0af9_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>My predictions about inability to sleep came true. I could hardly sleep that night with so many people in the room. Perhaps there was also part of altitude difference playing its role. In any case we got up relatively late at 5am to have breakfast and left the hut at about 6am.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28253929596"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8651/28253929596_07c62879ac_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>There was no rush as we were going to take a lift to Mittelallalin (3457m) station and walk from there. As it turned out, the lift opened later that we had expected so we had to wait. Furthemore, the Metro Alpin lift broke down. We waited in suspension hoping for the best. Fortunately, the team of mechanics departed with a helicopter and all technical problems were adressed in a couple of hours. Since our plans had sufficient slack even a significant delay like this didn&rsquo;t prevent us from completing the tour.</p>

<p>After the ride with the lift the tour turned bitter. Especially on the way down. I found the way to the summit and back uncomfortably fast. At times I felt that the rope is pulling me forward, dragging the ground from underneat my feet. I still don&rsquo;t understand why we had to rush so much. There were also too many other groups on the way. These two factors somewhat spoiled the atmosphere. The tour didn&rsquo;t feel good anymore. It felt like we were a tourist group shown around a popular sight somewhere in a middle of a large city.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27672491473"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8637/27672491473_8d76450ce6_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>Reaching the summit did not feel anything special. It was not deserved &mdash; we cheated our way through cable cars and lifts. And there were so many other folks!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27672185304"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8742/27672185304_c2567bf916.jpg" width="333"></a></p>

<p>Our crew at the summit:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28006658860"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8597/28006658860_19a702d00b.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d like to visit such popular peaks again, especially during a busy time like the weekend. I am also not sure about going with groups of people I haven&rsquo;t met before. It&rsquo;s certainly nice to meet new people but I think I prefer to go with the people I already know and trust. Despite certain mental dissatisfaction I&rsquo;m already signed-up for a follow-up trip in August. Let&rsquo;s hope we&rsquo;ll avoid some of the issues.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is part 2 of a series of articles themed &ldquo;Preparing for Software Engineer Interviews&rdquo;. My goal with the series is to document the steps I took while preparing for interviews for a software engineering position after working six years in predominantly support-leaning roles. I won&rsquo;t break new ground here but rather share personal experience &mdash; anything you see here is an echo of what you can find elsewhere on the Internet. But too much of a good thing could be bad. Too much advice obscures itself and makes it hard to navigate. In <a href="/blog/2016/06/12/the-kata-of-code/">part 1</a> I explained how I improved my knowledge of algorithms and data-structures as well as introduced a regular coding exercise. In this part I will explain how I went about improving interview coding skills.</p>

<p>When I was originally confronted with preparing for interviews I pulled many online resources together: posts on quora and stackoverflow, blog posts, articles and forum discussions. Some of the posts were quite detailed and comprehensive. There is lot of common advice but I struggled because there was just too much to do and too many ways to go about it. I decided to follow a simple plan which I will shortly explain below.</p>

<p>What is so special about software engineer interviews? The basic premise of most coding interviews (we&rsquo;re talking about interviews at mostly large tech companies here) is to present a candidate with a novel problem that he has never seen before to see how good his reasoning and problem solving skills are. Presumably, a coding interview is a good indicator of candidate&rsquo;s abilities and real-world productivity. Seeing how the candidate struggles under pressure, comes up with brilliant solutions and communicates with the interviewer is a telltale sign of his future success at the company. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s only a presumption and the reality is complicated but at the moment most tech companies stick to the same format which means that candidates must eventually go through it. So let&rsquo;s look through some preparation ideas and shed some bullshit along the way.</p>

<p>First, there&rsquo;s the novelty issue. It is not feasible to come with a completely new coding problem for every interview. Instead, inteviewers usually rely on a limited repertoire of problems. These problems eventually leak out and get shared online. More importantly, though, many problems share similar problem-solving strategies. Once the insight is known to a candidate the problem reduces to relatively painless translation to code. I&rsquo;ve seen judgements against candidates that try to memorize solutions. But how can a solution be memorized? There are not 10 or 20 problems out there. There are hundreds, even thousands. Nobody would try to memorize the solution code line by line. But it is fair to assume that candidates memorize ideas and patterns behind the problems. How else could the candidates do well on interviews? Let&rsquo;s take mathematics. Undeniably there is lots of memorization involved when learning any subject in mathematics. We can&rsquo;t assume that candidates come up with algebra concepts from scratch during their short stay. Why then would it be fair to expect candidates to come up with algorithms that took very distinguished and persistent computer scientists and engineers to come up with?</p>

<p>In short, obtaining the insight and patterns behind coding problems and memorizing the right things is in my opinion the essence of interview preparation. Even the most distinguished engineers admit that in their day to day work they rarely get a chance to tackle difficult algorithmic challenges. I&rsquo;m not saying that advanced skills are unnecessary and everyone should be an API coding monkey. I&rsquo;m saying that candidates must work through typical coding problems, extract vital problem solving patterns and approaches. The fact remains, though, that some amount of memorizing is unavoidable. If a candidate didn&rsquo;t have a need to optimize things at a very low level it&rsquo;s unlikely he&rsquo;ll come up with a good solution for bit twiddling questions even though he understands the underlying concepts well. He just wouldn&rsquo;t have enough time. And certain efficient solutions are very clever to the point of being obscure and unintuitive. There&rsquo;s little chance of coming up with one during 45 stressful minutes.</p>

<p>In fact, I would go as far as to say that some solutions must be memorized almost to the point of line by line. Okay, maybe not that far. But there are a some smaller-sized questions that interviewers like to ask as a warm-up. For example, to implement a power function or the greatest common divisor function. The thing is, interviewers expect flawless and, most importantly, quick (read immediate) implementation. Even if a candidate understands the idea it might take too long to translate that idea into code on the board. Plus, there are many possibilities for subtle common bugs, such as off-by-one errors, out-of-bounds, etc. Normally, a programmer is not rushed so there&rsquo;s sufficient time to think, sketch pseudocode, implement and take care of edge cases. Because the problem is not difficult the interviewer will pick apart even the smallest mistakes and attach disproportionate weight to them. Clearly, candidates that prepared well will look more capable although it is debatable if their performance difference would translate in anything measurable in the real world.</p>

<p>Once a candidate gets exposed to a sufficient amount of problems (in the range of hundreds) there comes a plateau point. That&rsquo;s completely normal and expected. Despite the acquired experience many problems won&rsquo;t seem any easier. That&rsquo;s also normal. In fact, this discourages many aspiring competitive programmers from further pursuing the challenge. Certain kinds of problems do not fall under neat patterns and require a different mindset. I personally haven&rsquo;t yet managed to overcome this plateau. The good news is that such problems are rarely, if ever, asked in interviews. The bad news is that getting good at difficult problems worsens performance at interview problems. And the reason is that one tries to apply unconvential and complex data-structures and algorithms whereas most interview coding problems are centered around a set of relatively simple tools. Dead-ends are time consuming and reduce chances of solving the problem. After going through many rounds of mock interviews (which I discuss in the 3rd part of the series) I realized that I must recalibrate my toolkit and stick to simplest tools unless everything else fails. When my first thought reaches for a suffix tree I resist and instead try one of the following (not exhaustive): sorting, using a queue/stack, traversing, reversing, doing binary search, recursing. I also find it helpful to think of a brute force solution first. The lesson is that most coding problems are simple and rarely involve anything exotic. When they do the interviewer is prepared to almost immediately spill the beans on the magic insight.</p>

<p>So how to go about actually preparing? I have taken a whole month of full-time effort to specifically practice interview coding problems. There are many popular sources with coding problems, to name a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.topcoder.com/">TopCoder</a> &mdash; not suited well for interview preparation because of the nature of the problems, weird problem classification and an arcane UI. TopCoder is really a tool for competitive programming and it&rsquo;s not designed for practicing interview problems. Given time constraints and different goals in mind I wouldn&rsquo;t spend time on TopCoder.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://uva.onlinejudge.org/">UVA judge</a> &mdash; automated system for submitting solutions to various competitive programming problems. Suffers from similar problems as TopCoder. Also, just like with TopCoder, it is hard to keep track of progress or to cover all topics.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850">Cracking the Coding Interview book</a> &mdash; extremely popular book with around 150 coding problems and solutions. I went through an earlier edition years ago. Haven&rsquo;t seen or used the recent one.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.interviewbit.com/">interviewbit</a> &mdash; a well designed system specifically for preparing for interviews. Problems are classified by topics. There&rsquo;s search functionality that lets, for example, to search for problems asked at certain companies. interviewbit also has an excellent gamified progress tracking functionality. Unfortunately, I found out too late about it. Otherwise, I would have likely used it as a primary preparation tool.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Java-Adnan/dp/1517671272">Elements of Programming Interviews in Java (EPI) book</a> &mdash; this is my choice! The books comes with hundreds of problems with clear explanations of brute-force and optimal solutions. C++ edition is also available.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a> &mdash; feels like a system which serves both competitive programming and interview preparation well. There are many practice problems classified by topics and regular hosted competitions. I have used HackerRank as a complementary resource.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksForGeeks</a> &mdash; a daily blog of coding problems. I have yet to come across an interview coding problem that is not published there.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Once I settled on a primary source I&rsquo;ve done two passes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go through every problem in the EPI book and solve them algorithmically without writing any code. I&rsquo;ve set a time limit of 10-15 minutes per problem. Once the time limit expired I consulted the solution. I think it&rsquo;s better to have a time limit rather than get stuck for hours on a problem. Generally, I think it&rsquo;s great to sometimes persist on a problem until it cracks but given the goals of interview preparation it&rsquo;s more effective to absorb as many concepts as possible. For every problem I wrote down the main insight. It took me about 2 weeks to finish the whole book.</p></li>
<li><p>Go through every solved problem and write code for it. This is where I realized that my previously-written notes were terrible so I often had to solve the problems again. I wrote code on paper and I felt that writing code with the insight in hand is easy. I&rsquo;m sure there are folks for whom finding the insight is easier.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I complemented EPI with problems from the HackerRank site. Finally, during two weeks leading to interviews I also solved every problem marked with the company I was applying for on interviewbit. You&rsquo;d be surprised just how often widely publicized problems are still actively asked in interviews so it pays to go through them. I haven&rsquo;t actually used interviewbit as a platform. Instead, I just read the problem descriptions and solved them on paper. Whenever I got stuck I consulted the hints or complete editorials (solutions).</p>

<p>After putting so much effort in the preparation can I say it was worth it? Did it help to get an offer? Getting good at solving coding interview problems takes a considerable effort and it is not a sure guarantee of success. However, a lack of such preparation is a sure guarantee of failure. There are too many factors vying for the final hire/no hire decision and success is anything but guaranteed. Just like with the algorithm and data-structure study I feel this effort made me a little bit better as a programmer. And just like with <a href="/blog/2016/06/12/the-kata-of-code/">algorithm katas</a> I would like to adopt a habit of regularly solving coding problems to improve further.</p>

<p>In the concluding part 3 I will talk about the final interview preparation steps and also talk about the psychological challenges that many candidates such as myself face before and during the interviews and the ways to tackle them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I enjoy training for triathlon immensely. The sport attracts me with multidimensionality and the numerous skills involved. There is so much room for growth. It&rsquo;s an art really. I will regularly share some of my observations as I progress towards my next triathlon goal &ndash; <a href="/blog/2015/12/14/a-long-new-journey-ahead/">completing a half Ironman</a>.</p>

<h2>Cycling</h2>

<p>After <a href="/blog/2016/05/28/indoor-cycling-lab/">raving about Zwift</a> and following its 4 month training program I chose to continue my training using <a href="https://www.trainerroad.com/">TrainerRoad</a> software instead. These two programs cannot be directly compared because they serve completely different purposes. While Zwift provides a 3D virtual world to make indoor rides exciting TrainerRoad focuses instead on a quality selection of training programs and virtual coaching.</p>

<p>What do I mean by virtual coaching? During each session TrainerRoad guides you with advice regarding correct technique and the training session itself. The implementation is very simple &ndash; just regular text messages. But for a newbie like myself getting bite-sized pieces of fundamental cycling wisdom is invaluable.</p>

<p>For example, I had a bit of a toe-numbing problem. My toes would get numb by the middle of the training session. I have partially solved the problem by sliding my feet forward in relation to the pedal spindles and also by moving the saddle slightly forward. However, numbing did not disappear completely. Out of despair I contemplated buying road-specific shoes and pedals. But during one of the first sessions TrainerRoad addressed the issue by explaining the correct kick-and-pull pedaling technique. The idea was reinforced by the single-leg cycling intervals. Numbing went away once and for all!</p>

<p>Same goes for other basics, like breathing and body position. Explanations are brief and to the point. The ideas are regularly reminded and reinforced through practice.</p>

<p>Initially, I chose a medium-volume training program and sticked to the assessed FTP value of 204 watts. After a couple of training sessions I realized this is above my level so I reset my FTP at 190 watts and chose the most basic training program. There&rsquo;s no point trying to jump ahead of myself. Overtraining leads to exhaustion and loss of motivation. I&rsquo;m in this sport for the long-haul so I must not torture myself if I want to go on.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m all set with cycling for the next 3-4 weeks. Afterwards I&rsquo;ll choose a training program that builds on top of the current one. I feel TrainerRoad will provide me with sufficient training material for the next couple of months.</p>

<h2>Swimming</h2>

<p>I started with swimming in October 2015. I went for a week worth of private coaching. I never trained so my form was as bad as it gets. At the time I had no idea how front-crawl works but I knew an efficient swimming form is vital for competition. Following that session I made a habit to visit a local swimming pool 3 times a week. I alternated sessions between doing crawl-related exercises and longish 2k breast-stroke swims. The latter also improved my breathing and endurance.</p>

<p>In March 2016 I signed-up for a front-crawl course. At the moment I can swim crawl 50 metres non-stop and actually feel relaxed and enjoy it! The next step is to do 200-300m stretches without any rest. During a typical training session I combine exercises (e.g. kickboard) and training intervals, typically 200m long. In a few months I&rsquo;ll need further coach input to improve my form but at the moment I have plenty of practice to complete on my own.</p>

<h2>Running</h2>

<p>This is the saddest part. While my <a href="/blog/2016/05/27/rigimarsch-2016/">fractured tibia seemed to be completely recovered</a> it started to act up again. About two weeks ago I started with 4 short runs per week (each 3km long). After the 5th session I felt my tibia again. It&rsquo;s nowhere close to the <a href="/blog/2016/05/27/rigimarsch-2016/">pain I experienced during the half-marathon when it actually fractured</a> but I must be careful not to make it worse. I wouldn&rsquo;t even call it pain. It&rsquo;s more of a whining feeling.</p>

<p>I have decided to space out the runs until there&rsquo;s no pain remaining. I&rsquo;m looking at a run every two weeks right now. I definitely won&rsquo;t make any aerobic advancements with such a tempo but my primary target is to get the bone strong again. I also consider incorporating intervals into the sessions. And by intervals I mean interleaving walking with running.</p>

<h2>Gear</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in the cycling section I <em>wanted</em> (already a wrong attitude) to buy road-specific shoes (likely black SIDIs) and road-specific pedals (likely Shimano 105). Better pedaling technique solved the problem so for now I can keep my trusted Shimano XT pedals and Specialized Rime shoes (which are walkable off the bike).</p>

<p>Despite previous discomfort I re-installed a proper racing seat &mdash; Brooks C13. Turns out I had incorrectly kept my body on the seat. The correct posture keeps both siting bones in contact with seat wings. Instead, I had been leaning my hips too much forward, causing too much stress on the pubic bone. Once I changed my posture comfort issues went out of the window!</p>

<h2>Misc</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done a first pass through &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Triathletes-Training-Bible-Joe-Friel/dp/1934030198">The Triathlete&rsquo;s Training Bible</a>&rdquo; &mdash; an excellent book for anyone who&rsquo;s seriously interested in the sport. It&rsquo;s much better than a few titles I had previously laid my eyes on. The book is ripe with subtance and with experience distilled from a career of coaching. I feel I&rsquo;m getting a little bit ahead of myself. Most of the advice in the book applies to experienced athletes with at least a couple of years of experience who are aiming at improving performance. My current goals are far less ambitious. I want to gracefully finish a half Ironman. But I figure there&rsquo;s no harm knowing what lies ahead and avoiding common pitfalls.</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;ve started regular triathlon training (roughly January 2016) I&rsquo;ve lost 5 kg. The current weight seems to be stable at about 74kg. I&rsquo;m not yet doing anything special in regards to nutrition yet but I&rsquo;m planning to introduce a post-training recovery drink next month.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about it for now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is part 1 of a series of articles themed &ldquo;Preparing for Software Engineer Interviews&rdquo;. My goal with the series is to document the steps I took while preparing for interviews for a software engineering position after working six years in predominantly support-leaning roles. I won&rsquo;t break new ground here but rather share personal experience &mdash; anything you see here is an echo of what you can find elsewhere on the Internet. But too much of a good thing could be bad. Too much advice obscures itself and makes it hard to navigate. In this part I will explain how I went about refreshing and improving knowledge of algorithms and data structures.</p>

<p>A fancy word makes even the most mundane things sound legitimate. Enter &lsquo;kata&rsquo; &mdash; a fancy way of saying that one does something mundane, regularly. Originally, the Japanese word &lsquo;kata&rsquo; stands for a very specific kind of practice in traditional arts. But in the programming world it&rsquo;s synonymous with a repetitive coding practice. I have no opinion in the linguistic department but I believe the practice might have some substance. Let me rewind a little bit.</p>

<p>Exactly one year ago I <a href="/blog/2015/06/16/why-i-have-quit-an-awesome-job/">left a wonderful job in one of the best places to work</a> on this planet. With such a drastic move there&rsquo;s a multitude of reasons. One of the major ones is my ambition to become an excellent software engineer and steer away from the technical support role I had so far pursued.</p>

<p>The first obstacle on the way are the well-known and sometimes wacky software interviews that most respectable companies seem to rely on for choosing among candidates. To prepare myself for the challenge I devised a multi-month plan. About 3 months ago, as I was done with another full-time endeavour, I put the plan through its paces. In this article I&rsquo;ll do my best to explain the first step of the plan &mdash; the study and practice of algorithms and data-structures.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve never studied algorithms. In fact, I hold a computer science degree and have completed several excellent online algorithm-focused courses with top marks (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI">Algorithms Part I</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII">Algorithms Part II</a>). But annoyingly if you had asked me to implement a path-finding algorithm or even an O(N*LogN) sorting algorithm I would have struggled without referring to technical books or articles. Should you have asked the same question straight after I had just completed the courses I would have absolutely no issues. From a limited personal survey of fellow engineers it is a very common situation. Few keep algorithms in their heads.</p>

<p>Clearly, without an excellent understanding of algorithms passing a coding interview is unlikely. Besides, algorithms and data structures are the cornerstones of computer science and software. Without the understanding of basic structures it&rsquo;s not possible to solve most of the coding challenges. So I dedicated the first month of preparation to the study of algorithms.</p>

<p>However, as I&rsquo;ve already learned, the chosen method of study is critical. It&rsquo;s all to easy to complete a course or a book and then forget everything few weeks after. It is also not sufficient to merely browse through a book or a bunch of articles. Superflous reading creates a perilous illusion of understanding. It is imperative to work through. That&rsquo;s why going through one algorithms book takes a month of full-time effort and not an afternoon. I also emphasize that I had completed algorithm courses before starting this effort. Otherwise, it would make sense to study through the online courses mentioned above first. It would also significantly lengthen the plan.</p>

<p>As there are many more algorithms than the time available to me I had to optimize. It makes little sense to study the most esoteric and domain-specific algorithms for the purpose of preparing for software interviews. I made a survey of interview-related Q&amp;As and websites and came up with the following initial list of algorithms and data structures (in no particular order):</p>

<pre><code>* Stack/Queue (based on LinkedList)
* Selection Sort
* SeparateChainingHashST
* LSD/MSD sort (Radix)
* Graph/Digraph/WeightedGraph
* Edge/EdgeWeightedGraph
* DFS/BFS
* Binary Search
* Weighted Quick Union
* Insertion Sort
* Shell Sort
* DFSPaths/BFSPaths
* Cycle detection in undirected graph
* Connected Components with DFS in undirected graph
* Bipartite check in undirected graph (two color)
* Merge Sort
* Bottom-up Merge Sort
* Quicksort
* 3-way Quicksort
* CountSort
* Min/MaxPQ
* Heapsort
* BST
* Red-black BST
* LinearProbingHashST
* Cycle detection in directed graph
* DFS order and Topological sort
* Kosaraju-Sharir Strong Connected Components in directed graph
* Kruskal MST
* Prim MST
* Dijkstra SP
* Acyclic SP
* Bellman-Ford SP
* Knuth-Morris-Prath search
* Boyer-Moore search
</code></pre>

<p>It is debatable if some of the algorithms in this list are already too complex for general software engineering interviews (knowledge of esoteric algorithms might be required for more senior or specialized roles). In fact, as practice went by I added a few additional ones and removed a few.</p>

<p>The book I chose for my study is &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X">Algorithms, 4th edition</a>&rdquo; from Robert Sedgewick at Princeton University. It&rsquo;s written by the same professor that teaches the corresponding online courses. What sets it apart from other famous algorithm texts is the focus on visually illustrating algorithms and doing algorithm-tracing exercises. Working through an algorithm on paper and tracing all the steps helps to grasp what the algorithm really does. Through these exercises I uncovered that my mental models for some of the algorithms were wrong. The other huge benefit of this book is a <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/">complementary codesite</a> with lots of high-quality and clearly-written implementations of algorithms in Java.</p>

<p>My daily routine consisted of reading about one topic and related algorithms and then trying to re-implement the algorithms myself. As soon as I stumbled I looked-up the text. The complementary code is extremely readable. The implementations may lack some of the fanciest and trickiest optimizations but are invaluable tools for learning. Once I implemented the code I erased and started from scratch, testing thoroughness of my understanding.</p>

<p>As the days went by and I progressed further I felt that I no longer remembered the details of algorithms I had already worked-through. That&rsquo;s when I decided to introduce additional regular algorithm coding practice &mdash; katas. I grouped some of the algorithms together. Then during each practice session I would implement algorithms and data-structures from the top of my head, copying only test cases from the reference implementation. At times I would get stuck. In those moments I learned a little bit more about each algorithm. Often, I would get confused and need to look-up the reference implementation. Next time, though, the practice would become easier and more automatic. Katas keep the algorithm knowledge functional and fresh. Furthermore, being able to implement some of the tricky algorithms from the top of my head on a napkin increases confidence which may sometimes shake under the many stresses of interviews. Finally, being able to implement many algorithms quickly pays off in coding competitions.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the original katas are canonical. My coding katas are certainly not. They evolve and change with time. At some point easier algorithms and data-structures become trivial and it no longer makes sense to practice them. I don&rsquo;t practice writing a stack/queue anymore. Sometimes I realize how similar few algorithms are so I leave one of them out. Many graph problems reduce to DFS. Occasionally I study through new algorithms and add them to katas. For example, I&rsquo;ve recently added SkipList and SuffixArray. I also group algorithms so that each kata is of similar size. At the moment I have <a href="https://github.com/drseergio/practice/tree/master/katas">5 katas in my repertoire</a>. It takes about 30-60 minutes to complete each one. I aim to complete all of the katas once a week &mdash; on average less than one kata per day. I&rsquo;m also timing my practice now to see how long each kata takes.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s a distilled version of the algorithm study plan (~1 month of full-time effort)</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>List algorithms/data-structures you need to learn deeply. When in doubt leave it out. Make it as short as feasible. Can always add more later.</li>
<li>Choose an algorithms text. I recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X">&ldquo;Algorithms, 4th edition&rdquo; by Robert Sedgewick</a>.</li>
<li>Schedule sufficient time each day to read the text and implement algorithms by hand. Keep premature enthusiasm at hand and keep the workload manageable. There&rsquo;s a reason it takes a month.</li>
<li>Collect algorithm implementations and group them into katas.</li>
<li>Regularly perform katas by reimplementing algorithms.</li>
<li>Revise katas, remove trivial algorithms and add new ones as you see fit.</li>
<li>Repeat 6, 7.</li>
</ol>


<p>I&rsquo;d like to believe that this study of algorithms and practice of katas will pay off. It is hard to say, taking into account the many factors that affect a hiring decision. Doing a comprehensive study like this won&rsquo;t guarantee success but doing nothing almost certainly guarantees failure. The study of algorithms is just the first interview preparation step. I&rsquo;ve introduced katas as means to not forget what I&rsquo;ve just learned. But as I&rsquo;ve practiced and grown my personal collection I see myself continuing with katas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Exactly two weeks ago I thought I was exhausted from preparing for job interviews (I will write a separate post explaining my study strategy). After all, I have been averaging 6-8 hours of algorithms and Java study almost every day for 2 months (I am switching careers and going full-time in software engineering). In reality, it was a virus that caused physical break-down, an eye infection and fever. In what can be described as the most spontaneous decision of my life I decided we need to take a short break and go to the sea. How spontaneous? I felt debilitating headache Monday morning and we flew out on Wednesday.</p>

<p>So we chose a destination we could fly to ASAP that had decent weather and warm sea. In the end we went to Crete. I had previously visited Crete 10 years ago. Crete left an impression not only with the warm Mediterranean climate and usual resort-world bells and whistles but also with a natural wonder I couldn&rsquo;t visit at the time. I&rsquo;m talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samari%C3%A1_Gorge">Samaria Gorge</a>. It was time to finally hike it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26720077554"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7444/26720077554_8d954f1239_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>I am amazed at how the local businesses managed to market and sell Samaria Gorge and lull even the most unprepared unfit tourists, making it a must-visit attraction. In the high season, which unsurprisingly is the worst time of the year to visit it, Samaria Gorge attracts 30,000-40,000 tourists per month. Some of those tourists later write horror stories as to how difficult and extreme the whole experience was. Legends get born and rumors get spread.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m here to bust some myths. First of all, it is not the largest Gorge in Europe. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdon_Gorge">Verdon Gorge</a> is. Second, it is not an extremely difficult adventure. It&rsquo;s best described as a hike of medium-easy difficulty. Most of the time the route descends which is admittedly not my favorite (I prefer ascents or mixed terrain). While the terrain is rocky there is nothing extreme about it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26720813773"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7251/26720813773_bb58db0b87_n.jpg" width="213"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27052274170"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7653/27052274170_654d0d72a3_n.jpg" width="213"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27257029391"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7006/27257029391_246c4a35bb_n.jpg" width="213"></a></p>

<p>In terms of gear the hike requires mostly decent shoes. I brought the most minimal and lightweight shoes I own and they were just fine. Apparently the overly successful marketing attracts unsuspecting couch potatoes in flip-flops but I haven&rsquo;t spotted a single person whose clothing stood out as outlandlishly inadequate.</p>

<p>Without any strain we completed the walk in 5:45. We took lots of pictures and made one stop for packed breakfast in the old Samaria village which is in the middle of the route. My watch counted 20Km but I suspect that&rsquo;s due to errors due to poor sky visibility in the gorge. Officially, the total distance from the park entrance to the beach is approximately 17Km. Sounds realistic.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/590696789">View our GPS track on Strava</a></p>

<p>End of May is a fantastic time to visit it because the gorge is full of life: vegetation and flowers. Most importantly, it is not scorching hot. I find that the scenery becomes interesting after the Samaria village, roughly 8-10Km into the hike. The first half is similar to a walk in a park and it&rsquo;s not possible to see much of the gorge. But the actual gorge looks breathtaking.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27230250722"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7349/27230250722_01d870f748_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>In fact, I would consider visiting the park in the opposite direction: arriving by ship at the end of the route in the morning, exploring the gorge area up to the Samaria village and taking the ship back. It&rsquo;s possible to pull this off with a rental car by keeping it in the town from where the ship departs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27257075871"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7001/27257075871_daabee70cf_n.jpg" width="213"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27230278702"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7370/27230278702_2a68bc4ed6_n.jpg" width="213"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27052293150"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7439/27052293150_bf9f47ae31_n.jpg" width="213"></a></p>

<p>Speaking of transportation it&rsquo;s not great. There are only 3 ships per day: 2 in the morning and only one in the afternoon at 17:30. Those who finish reasonably at about 14:00-15:00 are doomed to stay in the area. Admittedly, the area ain&rsquo;t bad and the beach is completely worth a visit. In case somebody doesn&rsquo;t make it to the ship there are plenty of rooms available for rent.</p>

<p>We chose to get to the park and back by taxi. The price is not unreasonable if staying near city of Chania. For us, the higher taxi price was worth extra hours in the morning and in the evening. A tourist bus takes longer because it needs to pick-up tourists from various hotels.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26720065894"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7558/26720065894_49f0bc7d21_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re visiting Crete pack a pair of shoes &mdash; the gorge is worth a visit!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Around Christmas in 2015 I received doctor&rsquo;s diagnosis that my left tibia bone is fractured and that I can&rsquo;t run for the foreseeable future. Of course, I tried against all reason but the persisting pain made me realize it&rsquo;s in my own best interest to let it heal peacefully and not break it completely. Luckily, I discovered that cycling and swimming don&rsquo;t hurt at all. I suppose that&rsquo;s because the load spread is altered and tibia is not as stressed.</p>

<p>I decided not to lose any time and began training straight away. I have setup an indoor training &ldquo;lab&rdquo; and rigorously followed a training routine three times a week. Although I have been an avid cyclist my level of cycling fitness could have been ranked as &ldquo;beginner&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve had plenty of distance under my belt but insufficient endurance to sustain intensive effort necessary in competitive cycling. The training program has slowly come to a successful end and I would like to showcase my setup.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27306868565"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7345/27306868565_5c29150c79_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>I previously found the idea of indoor cycling trainers a boring pasture. However, training indoors has its merits. The biggest advantage I see is the possibility of structured training where the load of every training session is carefully chosen to stimulate improvement in the areas that need it the most. It is very difficult to go for a ride with friends and keep a specific tempo. With an indoor trainer it&rsquo;s possible to define fine-grained intervals with specific intensity. There are training programs for improving overall cycling fitness or, for example, improving climbs or sprints.</p>

<p>Of course, there is also the convenience factor. With an indoor trainer I have no excuse skipping a training session due to bad weather. It&rsquo;s always available and takes no time to get started with it.</p>

<p>But what really attracted me are the so-called smart trainers, like the <a href="http://eu.wahoofitness.com/devices/kickr.html">wahoo Kickr</a> that I purchased. The smart trainers are dynamically controlled by software so the resistance is continuously updated. Smart trainers can simulate changing terrain and most importantly let the user focus on cycling. With the regular &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; trainers the user must adjust resistance manually. I think I would get tired of it very quickly and would definitely cheat by not being timely in amping up the difficulty.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26700511863"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7605/26700511863_2f9435ffaf_n.jpg" width="213"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27236905401"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7352/27236905401_bf09f5907b_n.jpg" width="213"></a></p>

<p>There are various tools for controlling smart trainers. Some run on Android and iOS devices while others require full desktop OSes. Either bluetooth or ANT+ wireless protocols are used to interface with the trainers. I purchased an ANT+ adapter for my computer for the purpose of controlling the smart trainer and also for accessing data from a heart rate band and a power meter sensor on my bike.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27209876762"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7323/27209876762_5bafeb4735.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The &ldquo;killer app&rdquo; for me is surely <a href="http://zwift.com/">Zwift</a>. It&rsquo;s a well-implemented detailed immersive 3D virtual cycling world. Zwift is capable of controling smart trainers and simulating terrain. For all the user cares he is presented with a detailed simulation that brings variety and much needed distraction to otherwise boring workouts. Zwift is a open-world multiplayer game with other cyclists riding along. Zwift integrates nicely with Strava, here is a couple of my own workouts:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/554205363">https://www.strava.com/activities/554205363</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/536343127">https://www.strava.com/activities/536343127</a></p>

<p>Zwift also supports structured training. There are multiple training programs to choose from. It&rsquo;s also possible to create a custom one. I chose a 12-week program aimed at increasing overall cycling fitness and specifically improving the Functional Threshold Power (FTP). With ilnesses, travel and other commitments in place the program actually took me more than 4 months to complete.</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tqf5dD-ofQg "></iframe></div>


<p>I have complemented the setup with a webcam mounted on a tripod and connected to my mobile computer. This allowed to see my posture and make continous corrections. A mirror would work even better but there is no place in my room for one and I already had all the components to make a &ldquo;high-tech mirror&rdquo; solution work.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26699661594"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7311/26699661594_317dc183ac_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>This is how I see myself during a typical workout (videos are not focused very well but the idea should be clear):</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CntF-2F9kGc "></iframe></div>


<p>Speaking of complements I discovered a few additional pieces of technology I consider vital for training and worthy of an immediate purchase. First of all, a bicycle computer or a training watch equipped with GPS and ANT+/Bluetooth interfaces. I went for both, choosing a Garmin 920XT watch and a Garmin Edge 500 cycling computer. These gadgets track workouts and allow the user to see his progress and make corrections. Having these devices is a luxury that had been available only to professional athletes in the past. Basically, it&rsquo;s like having a personal coach watch over your shoulder every moment.</p>

<p>The reason I own both is because a cycling computer is convenient for glancing at many fields at a time, without taking the hand off the handlebar. I use the cycling computer exclusively for viewing data. In fact, I bought it used at a bargain price. I don&rsquo;t cosider fancier products worthwhile.</p>

<p>Finally, a power meter is becoming increasingly popular. I&rsquo;m going so far as to say that a power meter is a complete must, especially if the user is an amateur interested in racing. A power meter basically quantifies the effort the user is currently putting out. It takes guessing out of the training. With a power meter I can adjust my power output and effort during a ride. For example, in a race I could adjust power output depending on the course to avoid overstrain. I could immediately see if the current effort is sustainable or not based on past observations. Smart trainers come with built-in power meters but I&rsquo;ve added a relatively inexpensive <a href="http://stagescycling.com/us/products/">Stages power-meter</a> for upcoming outdoor rides.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27306885605"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7208/27306885605_5158cd1438_n.jpg" width="320"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26699671554"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7311/26699671554_64e405b1c0_n.jpg" width="320"></a></p>

<p>With the program almost finished what do I plan to do next? My <a href="/blog/2016/05/27/rigimarsch-2016/">tibia has recovered</a> and I&rsquo;m almost finished with a 4-month swimming training program. I am going to develop a new plan for the next 3-4 months. With the summer here I&rsquo;m definitely going outdoors but I&rsquo;ll combine the outdoor rides with more structured indoor training to hone some of the skills, like climbing. Training ain&rsquo;t easy but I get lots of satisfaction and joy out of it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another year, another <a href="http://rigimarsch.ch/">Rigimarsch</a>! <a href="/blog/2015/05/24/longest-non-stop-hike-in-my-life/">Last year</a> I&rsquo;ve participated in an annual night hike up to the Rigi mountain. It was a tough yet exhilerating experience. This year I&rsquo;ve repeated the challenge together with John.</p>

<p>The route was the same as always: 50 or so kilometers with a 1500m ascent in the last 10 kilometeres. However, the hike felt refreshingly different.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/566448675">View our GPS track on Strava</a></p>

<p>For me personally the hike was a test for the healing Tibia bone that fractured during last year&rsquo;s <a href="/blog/2015/10/31/goals/">half-marathon in Lausanne</a> (I ran 1/3 of the marathon with a fractured bone).</p>

<p>John looks cheerful but everybody is cheerful at the start:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27262027875"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7316/27262027875_338b6e78de_z.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>According to the official information a record 2363 people turned up for the event. Despite the crowd the registration went smoothly. We started walking at around 20:00.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26655251944"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7278/26655251944_ef51583b8c.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27262034825"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7542/27262034825_1b63a4dd46.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The Rigi mountain. It is intimidating to see the peak far ahead throughout the hike:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26656292463"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7482/26656292463_6e22257b37.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27262042505"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7337/27262042505_5bd6972a41.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27262043975"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7659/27262043975_f7ddbf3988.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s Rigimarsch took place on May 4th which is relatively early, compared to previous and future years. The event date is tied to Ascension day. Thanks to the early start there was plenty of snow at the top and the night temperatures were quite cool. I wore every piece of clothing I brought along.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26655268824"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7360/26655268824_c98e764931.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I felt energized and positive even in the last hours of the challenge. This is a huge departure from last year&rsquo;s impression. I still vividly recall just how difficult last few hours were. I think several factors are at play. First, I&rsquo;m in much better physical shape for aerobic activities because I switched from weight lifting to triathlon. Second, we brought trekking poles with us for the ascent. Finally, I came to the hike completely rested and fresh.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27192498811"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7539/27192498811_04efa1224b.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>John is still smiling at the top, that&rsquo;s the way to do it:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26655286494"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7711/26655286494_f43a8df2f0.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>Return train from Rigi to Arth-Goldau. There were enough places in the train for everyone to take a seat:</p>

<p><a href="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7443/27164821172_47541b80f6.jpg"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7443/27164821172_47541b80f6.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The hike took us about 12 hours to complete which is almost the same as last year. However, our moving time is a whole hour shorter which means we walked measurably faster but took longer breaks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a complete triathlon newbie I benefit tremendously from the experience and knowledge of others. Just a few little steps save years, if not decades, of trial-and-error, not to mention decrease chances of injuries and increase enjoyment of the sport. My friend Ilya Nedbailo who has successfully completed his first 70.3 Ironman in Rapperswil this year generously shared a couple of tips.</p>

<p>The first of which is getting a professional bike fitting service. I strongly believe that money spent on professional advice is worth much more than any piece of gear one may buy. A lot of human knowledge cannot be easily encoded in articles or books. One really needs one-to-one contact and quick feedback to understand the nuances of physical movement.</p>

<p>Ideally, one should do bike fitting before buying a bike. But almost any existing bike will do just fine. It&rsquo;s not unheard of to see people competing in triathlon on rigid mountain bikes. An existing road bike is certainly sufficient.</p>

<p>Choosing the right professional could be tricky, especially when there are many options. I followed Ilya&rsquo;s recommendation and went to a triathlon-focused sport store <a href="https://www.tempo-sport.ch/">Tempo-Sport AG</a> in Thalwil. I&rsquo;m glad I did because René Kuster is an experienced and dedicated counsellor. As someone who participates in the sport himself he went above the mandatory adjustments and explained what is important in the bike position and why. I find such human experience and knowledge vastly superior to impressive computerized tech. Surely a computerized solution yields correct measurements consistently every time. But who will check your pedaling technique, advise on body posture and check that you are using the right muscles when the fancy system is operated by a disinterested or an inexperienced clerk?</p>

<p>Surprisingly, my bike fits me like a glove. Even the stem length is perfect. We got the handlebar height and saddle position adjusted and then installed clip-on aero-bars. Then René explained me how to pull the pedals and told me to utilize core muscles to stabilize the body. In the subsequent training sessions I could really tell the difference: I kept myself in a good position by engaging core (acknowledged by disappearing wrist pain) and I did the pedal pull movement correctly (acknowledged by feeling muscle pain in a previously unknown area).</p>

<p>René has also suggested an upgrade path when I&rsquo;ll get the itch to spend money on improving my cycling performance. His top 3:</p>

<ol>
<li>road-bike specific pedals and shoes (I&rsquo;m currently using a XC combination of Shimano M780 pedals along with Specialized Rime shoes)</li>
<li>tight aero clothing</li>
<li>deep rim racing carbon wheels</li>
<li>everything else</li>
</ol>


<p>Once I got the bike fitted I built myself a &ldquo;cycling training lab&rdquo; at home which I&rsquo;ll explain in a separate post. For the other two disciplines I&rsquo;m going through a similar phase of collecting advice and early error correction. I&rsquo;ll share more as soon as I learn!</p>
