My name is Sergey Pisarenko. Sometimes I call myself Sergey Belkin. I live happily in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland with my wife Anna.

You can reach me by e-mail at **sergey** at this domain.

I used to believe one is defined by what he does for a living. I feel ecstatic through acts of creativity - writing software and taking photographs.

I hold an unorthodox set of views and perspectives on how to live a life. I bathe in joys of mindful existence. I strive for minimal possessions and simple living. I look forward to financial independence when passive investment income is going to support us.

At the moment I find myself working in technology sector, solving technical problems. I'm lucky big time for being part of a company that lets me stay true to myself.

I'm a two-wheel enthusiast. I commute by bicycle, take long road bike rides, go downhill mountain bike trails and explore remote places by motorbike.

I seldom spend time at home. Instead, I enjoy being in great Swiss outdoors: hiking, cycling, snowboarding and rock climbing, among other things.

Although I don't read news I love reading books and provoking thoughtful essays! You can find out what I'm reading by following my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5111037-sergey). Furthermore, I share my daily subscription list at [News sources](/news-sources).
