My name is Sergey Pisarenko. Sometimes I call myself Sergey Belkin. I live happily in Zürich, Switzerland with my wife Anna. I speak a little Züritutsch and German besides my native Russian along with English and Latvian.

I can't really say much about myself because it's obsolete as soon as I type it in and publish. At any given moment we're nothing else but snapshots of our own developing selves. Especially my written words are likely to contradict each other as I change for the better or worse.

With that said there are few things about me that tend to persist. I am curious and observant. I tend to get excited often and quickly. While these traits occasionally land me in trouble I'm more likely to understand others and embrace change.

I love challenge and I can't truly enjoy anything if it doesn't involve a fair amount of pain and difficulty. Somehow I feel joy and pain are synonymous.

Professionally I pursue computer science. I hold a degree in computer science specializing in software engineering. I've went through a fun jack-of-all-trades experience and learned enough about myself to understand what are my main areas of interest.

My hobbies are the least stable part of me. I'm currently training for a long course triathlon. From the three disciplines in triathlon I dig cycling the most. In fact, I'm a real bike freak with all the consequences. The least of which is that I own n+1 bikes and my home is decorated with bike art. When I need to escape reality and take a break from it all I ride an adventure motorcycle (admittedly not that well). I also savor a good hike or a climb in the mountains regardless of the time of the year. Oh, and whatever I do and wherever I go [I like to take photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/68217075@N08/)!
