This Saturday I had a pleasure to do my first "via ferrata" climb in Switzerland, in Pinut to be precise. Via ferrata routes do not require climbing experience. The idea is to climb up a mountain and various obstacles while being hooked-up to a metal cable that runs along the whole route. Equipment-wise prospective climbers need a harness, a via ferrata set (a Y-shaped lanyard with an energy absorber) and a helmet.

The weather was phenomenally good for late October. Air temperature has risen to almost 20C! Possibly, this has been the last day of the year in Switzerland to do such a climb. I'll be happy to do more via ferrata climbs next year - there are hundreds of routes throughout the country.
