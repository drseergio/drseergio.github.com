I always wanted to experiment with night photographs of the sky. A pre-requisite is a clear sky and as little light pollution as possible. The island of Rodos in Greece is a perfect contender.

Me and my wife took our little rental car and drove along the road while we searched for pitch black spots and possible places to stop. We found an ancient silk factory:

The result seems okay for a first try. I admit it was a bit scary to stand alone in the darkness in a middle of nowhere.
