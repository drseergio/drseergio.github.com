Recently I have given up on many tools, devices and services to simplify my life and focus on doing things, rather than focusing on maintaining the tools themselves. I used to rely on a R program to calculate investments according to the Ivy Portfolio model. The program ran in a lxc environment on a home headless PC. I decided to use a simpler solution so I made a Google Spreadsheet to make the calculations. As it turns out, the previous complexity was completely unnecessary.

Without further ado, below are the results for month November 2014:

{% codeblock %}
Instrument      Avg return      Invested?

VNQ             11.34%          Yes
MTUM            9.81%           Yes
VGLT            8.16%           Yes
{% endcodeblock %}

If there's any interest I can share my spreadsheet publicly. It is based on the work from the "Investing for a living" blog. I've cleaned it up, removed the parts I don't need and made it easy to change instruments.
