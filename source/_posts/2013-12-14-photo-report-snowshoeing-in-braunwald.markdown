The weather on weekends has been excellent lately. On December 8th me and my friend John went for a snowshoe hike close to Braunwald.

It was so warm that we took off our jackets.

The hike took about 4 hours. There's plenty of snow and we got our snowshoes on in about 35 minutes after beginning the trek.
