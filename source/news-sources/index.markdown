I find it difficult to find quality sources of news, thought provoking essays and articles. A good selection of sources is a balancing act. If the selection is small you don't get to stimulate thinking and expand knowledge. Get it too big and you're overwhelmed. Presented below is a curated list of blogs and websites that I subscribe to.

I hope you discover something new. I know my search is not over. I'd like to know what are your most valued sources.

Reading books is another joy of mine. You can find out what I'm reading by following my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5111037-sergey).

## Fueling curiosity

 * [Farnam Street](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com) - publishes excerpts from books and interesting ideas. If I had to choose just one blog/site this would be it.
 
 * [Nautilus](http://nautil.us/) - science magazine with a wide coverage of topics.

 * [Raptitude](http://www.raptitude.com/) - witty and illuminating essays on various topics in life.

 * [Aeon magazine](http://aeon.co/) - Aeon Magazine is an online magazine about nature, culture and ideas.

 * [Aeon film](http://aeon.co/film/) - Aeon Film screens contemporary and classic short documentaries, exploring the intersections between nature, culture and ideas.

 * [Jacobin magazine](https://www.jacobinmag.com) - Jacobin is a leading voice of the American left, offering socialist perspectives on politics, economics, and culture.

 * [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org/en.atom) - blog of the creator of CD baby.

 * [Successful Software](http://successfulsoftware.net/feed/) - blog of a software developer running a successful one man company.

## Photography

* [Digital Photography School](http://digital-photography-school.com/) - regular tips and guides on digital photography. I like the amount of published material. Frequent enough to be interesting to follow but not so much to become overwhelming.

## Early retirement/financial independence

 * [Early retirement extreme](http://earlyretirementextreme.com/) - a combination of simple living, anticonsumerism, DIY ethics, self-reliance, and applied capitalism.

 * [Mr Money Moustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) - achieving financial independence early through smart decisions and better life decisions.

 * [Financial Samurai](http://feeds.feedburner.com/FinancialSamurai) - personal finance blog focusing on financial independence.

## Personal development

 * [Steve Pavlina](http://stevepavlina.com/) - I don't believe in everything Steve writes but more often than not his articles provoke deep introspective thoughts and fuel an impetus for change.

## Technology

 * [Hacker News 150](http://feeds.feedburner.com/newsyc150) - a filtered list of items from Hacker News - social news aggregator popular with hackers, software engineers and entrepreneurs. Even with filtering I read less than 1/3 of all items.

 * [Schneier on Security](https://www.schneier.com/) - blog of a famous security technologist.

 * [I, Cringely](http://www.cringely.com/) - blog of a famous technology writer.

 * [Coding Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/) - blog from the creator of stackoverflow.com.

## Fun

 * [xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/) - no introduction necessary.

 * [oatmeal comic](http://theoatmeal.com/) - no introduction necessary.

## Purged/deprecated

At some point I have been subscribed to the feeds below but I no longer follow them:

 * [Dan Ariely](http://danariely.com/feed/) - <strike>blog of a well known behavioral economics researcher and the author of "Predictably irrational".</strike>

 * [Habrahabr](http://habrahabr.ru/) - <strike>(in Russian) an online tech-oriented community/aggregator. Most of the articles are written from scratch, rather than republished. I had to spent considerable amount of time unsubscribing from different channels to bring volume down to a manageable level. But apart from that inconvenience there is lots of interesting material that is not published in any other source that I read.</strike> Too much material to subscribe to. Might return to it if I find a narrow niche.
