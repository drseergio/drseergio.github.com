I find it difficult to find quality sources of news, thought provoking essays and articles. A good selection of sources is a balancing act. If the selection is small you don't get to stimulate thinking and expand knowledge. Get it too big and you're overwhelmed. Presented below is a curated list of blogs and websites that I subscribe to.

I hope you discover something new. I know my search is not over. I'd like to know what are your most valued sources.

## Fueling curiosity

 * [Farnam Street](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com) - publishes excerpts from books and interesting ideas. If I had to choose just one blog/site this would be it.
 
 * [Nautilus](http://nautil.us/) - science magazine with a wide coverage of topics.

 * [Raptitude](http://www.raptitude.com/) - witty and illuminating essays on various topics in life.

## Early retirement/financial independence

 * [Early retirement extreme](http://earlyretirementextreme.com/) - a combination of simple living, anticonsumerism, DIY ethics, self-reliance, and applied capitalism.

 * [Mr Money Moustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) - achieving financial independence early through smart decisions and better life decisions.

## Personal development

 * [Steve Pavlina](http://stevepavlina.com/) - I don't believe in everything Steve writes but more often than not his articles provoke deep introspective thoughts and fuel an impetus for change.

## Technology news

 * [Hacker News 150](http://feeds.feedburner.com/newsyc150) - a filtered list of items from Hacker News - social news aggregator popular with hackers, software engineers and entrepreneurs. Even with filtering I read less than 1/3 of all items.
