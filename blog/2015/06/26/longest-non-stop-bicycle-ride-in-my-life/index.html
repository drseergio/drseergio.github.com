<div class="entry-content"><p>After gruesome 27+ hours of cycling I feel elated to announce that I have successfully completed the challenge! I have cycled non-stop for 420.8 kilometers, climbing 4953 metres worth of hills and obstacles along the way. The ride has been the greatest physical challenge I&rsquo;ve done in my life. <a href="/blog/2015/05/24/longest-non-stop-hike-in-my-life/">The longest non-stop hike goes to 2nd place now</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a short summary of the ride:</p>

<p><a href="/images/400km_ride.png"><img src="/images/400km_ride.png" width="500"></a></p>

<p><em>Total distance</em>: 420.8km</p>

<p><em>Total vertical ascent</em>: 4953m</p>

<p><em>Difficulty</em>: <strong>extreme</strong></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s me before the ride, view from the balcony:

<h2>Planning and preparation</h2>

<p>The idea to set a new personal cycling distance record came to me rather unexpectedly while me and my wife were visiting Rodos last week. You see, relaxing beach vacations are not my thing. I suppose a 400km ride is a complementary yan for the beach vacation yin.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t obsessed over planning the route. I consulted the Swiss national cycling network and picked the easiest (in terms of elevation changes) one that was long enough. I decided on route number 9. Since the route was 100 kilometers too long I left out the first two sections.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.veloland.ch/de/routen/route-09.html">Route 9</a></p>

<p>I studied the map and the elevation chart. I have split the whole route in three major sections to make it digestible to my fragile and wimpy mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>the hardest 170 kilometers, involving a fair amount of climbs at night</li>
<li>medium-difficulty 80 kilometers, mostly already familiar to me</li>
<li>the easiest and flattest remaining 170 kilometers</li>
</ol>


<p>A long ride requires sufficient nutrition. Strava has estimated that I have burned 16k calories. Insufficient hydration and nutrition guarantee failure and muscle cramps. Prior to departure I stuffed two large meals into myself. I also purchased plenty of sport bars and drink mixes. In addition, I carried few fruits and sausages:
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/18547057214"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/395/18547057214_e599a9e733_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>Finally, I asked for live support from my friends. You offered priceless cheering. Without your support I would have given up!</p>

<h2>Transit</h2>

<p>Getting to the starting point took me almost 4 hours, 3 trains and a bus. I had to leave home at about 18:15 to get to Gstaad at 22:30. I started the ride at night to tackle climbs while I was still fresh and unencumbered with sleep deprivation. I wish I could have slept more before the ride but the excitement prevented me from dozing off.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/18981916410"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/440/18981916410_f34a47793b_z.jpg" width="427"></a></p>

<h2>The first section</h2>

<p>First section of the route was meant to be difficult and involve a fair amount of hill climbing. Even though I knew the elevation chart the route felt more demanding than I expected. The first few kilometers were especially unpleasant and I had all sorts of negative thoughts in my head. Darkness, headaches and a slight nausea did little to improve the mood. To fool myself I pretended that I&rsquo;m going to go home once the first section is over.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/18983445849"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/378/18983445849_e167a069a1_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/19143425246"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/446/19143425246_60568cd5c2_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>At about 5 in the morning, as the sun was slowly rising behind mountains, I climbed Brünig pass. Getting over the pass broke a psychological barrier. I knew that the worst uphill is over even as the elapsed distance was still insignificant.</p>

<p>At some point I felt really sleepy and decided to take an hour nap on a bench in a forest. I&rsquo;ve managed to get 30 minutes of sleep as the body was all too excited to rest for too long.</p>

<h2>The second section</h2>

<p>By the time I finished the first section I realized that I am hopelessly behind the original optimistic estimates. I was already 2 hours behind. Making it on time for the last train back home quickly morphed into an unrealistic fantasy. Fantasies are better suited for sitting at home with a cup of warm tea in front of a fireplace.</p>

<p>Predictably, I could not imagine riding the remaining 250 kilometers. I fooled myself again into cycling to the end of second section where my wife met me for lunch in a cafe. To make up for the slow speed I pushed really hard to finish by 16:00.</p>

<p>At the top of the last hill before a speedy descent into Pfäffikon I met a Swiss couple who were leisurely cycling and appreciating the scenery. After a quick exchange of pleasantries the man asked whether I&rsquo;m &ldquo;genießen&rdquo; (enjoying) my ride. His tone and posture made me imagine him with a glass of fine whiskey and a cigar: &ldquo;Sir, are you enjoying the splendid surroundings of Schwyz?&rdquo;. &ldquo;Most certainly, what an exquisite enjoyment it is&rdquo;.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/19169589025"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/357/19169589025_5e96b94d99_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>Pushing hard payed off as I remarkably arrived at 16:00 sharp! I gulped down a few glasses of delicous lemonade and ordered a main course.</p>

<h2>The final section</h2>

<p>Less than a half remained and I spinned enthusiastically. I went fast for about 4 hours before breaking down again. A proper meal feels substantial compared to sugary drinks and sport bars that burn out quickly and leave a sore aftertaste. I stopped for a quick meal at McDonalds and continued to the final 6 hour stretch.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, my leg muscles did not show any signs of exhaustion. My ass, on the other hand, hurt as hell! I suppose no matter how great a bicycle seat is it&rsquo;s no match for 27 hour rides. The pain is unavoidable. Moving around just makes things worse.</p>

<p>I started to have hallucinations. I found a good solution: to focus on the road and avoid looking at any objects, especially if the objects seem interesting.</p>

<p>The final 10 kilometers felt like an eternity: so far no matter how close. Time perception gets really distorted in moments like these.</p>

<h2>Arrival and going home</h2>

<p>I arrived at 01:45 in the morning to the city of Rorschach. As most German or Swiss towns it was completely dead and quiet at night. The first train left at 05:40 and none of the hotels had a 24-hour reception. I went to the train station and parked my bike next to a bench and tried to stay warm. I was uncontrollably shaking because my clothing was too thin for sitting still. The good thing about sleep deprivation though is that it makes time fly. Every time I peaked on my wristwatch from waking up from cold the time advanced 30-40 minutes. Time flies when you&rsquo;re sleep deprived!</p>

<h2>Impressions</h2>

<p>It has been an extraordinary ride. I would have never completed it if I knew all the gory detail of the terrain or that 15-20% of roads were unpaved. More than anything, it has been a battle with the mind. My mind was endlessly coming up with excuses to make a stop to end the suffering. But there was only one good way to stop the suffering: get to the destination. At that is achieved by spinning faster and not by having stops every 5 minutes.</p>

<p>When I arrived in the middle of night at the destination shaking from hypothermia I was thinking of a warm bed, food and my beloved wife. In that moment I truly appreciated how much a place called home means to me. I wanted to go back to the beach vacation I berated so much&hellip;</p>

<p>But a good night sleep clears up even the muddiest minds. As soon as I woke up fresh and rested I dismissed the mumbo jumbo and started to plan another adventure. Challenge is an indispensable part of my identity and it&rsquo;s about time I finally learn it.</p>
