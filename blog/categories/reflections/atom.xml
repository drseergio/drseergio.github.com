    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago I have deactivated my Facebook account. I&rsquo;ve been intending to do that for months. Finally, I&rsquo;ve left the service for good.</p>

<p>Looking all the way back to 2006 I don&rsquo;t have much to show for it. You can&rsquo;t call me an addict because I&rsquo;ve never been hooked as much as people around me. Nevertheless, whenever I had cared to open Facebook&rsquo;s trendy blue interface I have been bombarded with meaningless status updates and viral junk. Numerous pointless apps and games just intensified the noise.</p>

<p>The noise itself never bothered me that much. What really bothered me is the dismal quality of what users share. It&rsquo;s seems to be a common problem with all social media. Most users simply don&rsquo;t share anything worth anyone else&rsquo;s attention. Instead of sharing genuine experiences, reflecting on one&rsquo;s life or authoring insightful writing I&rsquo;ve seen boasting, junk videos, cynicism, meaningless quotes and cryptic posts. Combined, these make their authors feel special and invite pointless discussions.</p>

<p>Facebook always made me feel bad about myself or my life. Other people&rsquo;s experiences seem just so much more authentic and full of life. It&rsquo;s basically like trashy advertising that shows you happy folks cleaning toilets with a certain kind of solvent. But instead of random folks you see whoever you had added to your Facebook &ldquo;friends&rdquo; and instead of cleaning toilets you see them doing whatever is that they were doing.</p>

<p>There are ways to read the &ldquo;stream&rdquo; without feeling insecure and unsatisfied. But it&rsquo;s hard mental and spiritual work. Despite spending considerable time to embrace mindful and present living I find Facebook to be a tough opponent. Facebook pierces through peace like a full metal jacket bullet. It&rsquo;s better to let go and give it up altogether.</p>

<p>Generally, I like the premise of a social network like Facebook. In theory it could be great. Imagine having a close circle of people who exert an effort to distill and publish their thoughts. Imagine a circle of friends who take the time to break down their adventures and experiences into stories. I am in total awe when a person cares to think and write down her thoughts instead of just slapping a bunch of photos in my face. Even if a story is not very coherent or deep.</p>

<p>I understand why Facebook, or any social media for that matter, is like that. It&rsquo;s easier to write and share junk. It&rsquo;s our brains wired for infinite satisfaction. A collection of juicy and emotional posts trigger our long-forgotten instincts just like an unhealthy sugary/fatty meal does. Nobody voluntarily wants to spend time writing or reading long posts when a &ldquo;Wall&rdquo; is bursting with sugar-high gossip, funny and disgusting media. One must willingly overcome animal desires and instincts. Choose a high-value diet &ndash; provoking and challenging information sources.</p>

<p>Not to seem like a hypocrite but I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve shared much in a meaningful way myself. I have not shared much at all. I intend to change with this personal home page. It&rsquo;s far from being a first blog of mine &ndash; there were many before it. For me the hardest part in keeping a personal page is finding a meaningful reason to share. It&rsquo;s all to easy to make a blog nothing else but a collection of the same crappy posts you see in social networks. The reason I think it&rsquo;s different this time is I feel no rush. I enjoy reflecting and writing down thoughts. I truly don&rsquo;t care if there is no value in these musings. I truly enjoy doing it right now.</p>

<p>Hopefully, by some serendipitous encounter you will find this site and share either thoughts or values or hobbies with me. Although even less likely, I hope we meet and do something fun together!</p>
