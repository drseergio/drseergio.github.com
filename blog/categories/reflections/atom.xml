    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just like junkies deny their addictions I denied mine for as long as I could. Perhaps I am predisposed to addictions as I notice just how quickly obsessions form in my mind from even the most remote sparks of excitement. Mainstream drugs &mdash; alcohol, nicotine, etc &mdash; have never caught my fancy but the more subtle hijackers haven&rsquo;t left my brain&rsquo;s reward system untouched. In this post I&rsquo;m going share my struggle against a deeply rooted consumerism addiction that I have only recently taken a hold of. Overcoming consumerism, along with personal growth in <a href="/blog/2016/07/23/farewell-bmw-f800gs-adventure/">other areas</a>, was high on my priority list entering <a href="/blog/2015/06/16/why-i-have-quit-an-awesome-job/">an ongoing sabbatical</a>. And similarly to the recognized addictions I find getting oneself free of consumerism is a continuing challenge. I made a habit of writing personal checklists for repetitive tasks and also memos for tackling difficult situations. A couple of months ago I outlined concrete steps to take when I find myself again in the inevitable grip of the addiction. That memo is essentially the backbone of the post you are about to read.</p>

<p>What does &ldquo;consumerism&rdquo; actually mean? At the most basic level it is the insatiable preoccupation with acquiring shiny new things. Consumerism has many faces and forms &mdash; it is a true chameleon. It hides behind many facades and is called many names, such as &ldquo;gear acquisition syndrome&rdquo;, &ldquo;shopping&rdquo;, hobby", &ldquo;upgradeitis&rdquo;, and, as paradoxical as it may seem, even &ldquo;minimalism&rdquo;. The big issue with consumerism is that most people, myself included, are typically unaware of their strong addiction. Very few admit that their burning desire to buy something is a symptom of an illness. Instead, the need is perceived as part of a hobby or as a strong belief that the purchase will significantly enhance something in one&rsquo;s life. In fact, I see now that some of the hobbies I had pursued were fueled almost entirely by an attraction to the complementary gear, such as camera lenses or bike upgrades.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So what?&rdquo; one may ask. Isn&rsquo;t that harmless behavior, or a part of someone&rsquo;s (lack of) character? I find the various forms of consumerism a dentrimental habit that saps one of energy and focus. It is not just the burden on personal finances. It disrupts life and detracts attention from meaningful but difficult undertakings and realities to a form of immediate gratification. Consumerism is so deeply established and widespread that it&rsquo;s almost impossible to discuss it with anyone. It&rsquo;s like something everybody sees but doesn&rsquo;t want to talk about or address. Based on personal observations I see consumerism forming due to following triggers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Emotional fulfillment</em> &mdash; shiny new things soothe (albeit temporarily) pain in times of emotional discomfort, be that stress at work or unfulfilled ambitions. The common wisdom is that possessions don&rsquo;t bring long-term happiness. I naively believed that my purchases were purely rational and had nothing to do with the pursuit of happiness or emotional comfort. Yet I eagerly anticipated every courier delivery and experienced an intensive but a short-lived rush of joy upon receiving the object of desire. How ironic.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Escapism</em> &mdash; similarly, an urge to buy arises often when faced with difficult obstacles. Ambiguous long-term projects (e.g., at least few months long), fatigue from training, overload from too many priorities and an inability to change current negative circumstances are all examples of such obstacles. Consumerism diverts the attention from solving problems to thinking about the next best thing.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Daydreaming</em> &mdash; typically almost every purchase is accompanied by fantasies of improved life circumstances, exciting work opportunities, some kind of consistency and order (e.g. speakers in every room, Apple devices), amazing creativity, new ways of travel, better self-image or doubled productivity. A new minimalist wallet is so convenient it will immediately make my life focused and organized. A new camera lens will make me take ten times more pictures. New racing wheels will make me ten times faster. A computer upgrade will make me ten times more productive. It sounds ridiculous when put into words but images like that run through almost everyone&rsquo;s mind at one point or another.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The difficulty of addressing consumerism is its obsessive and impulsive nature. Once an impulse arises in the mind it is next to impossible to get rid of it. Once established, every second thought races to the idea of getting that one thing and the improved existence it brings along. It is the obsessive character of the consumerism that prevents productive existence, stifles creativity and detracts from the present moment. Typically, it all starts with an accidental glance at a product review, an ad or a random article. At times I initially found the thing even ridiculous or useless. But as the time went by the planted seed grew into a monster. Rational measures against consumerism are futile because the roots of the problem are emotional. No amount of budgeting or prohibition helps. There is always the &ldquo;one last purchase and then I&rsquo;m all set&rdquo; argument, as if the purchase completes some kind of a perfect inner world or a survival toolkit. Naturally, the state of equilibrium is brittle and doesn&rsquo;t last very long &mdash; there are accessories to add and new &ldquo;minimalist&rdquo; gear to replace the old stuff with. I have mentioned &ldquo;minimalism&rdquo; many times in the context of consumerism. I don&rsquo;t have anything against the ideology of getting by with as few things as possible. At the same time I see that the noble pursuit often turns into an infinite buying spree. Something is fundamentally wrong when the ambition of minimalism is realized through even more acquisitions.</p>

<p>It is difficult to overcome any addiction, be that smoking or something as seemingly benign as consumerism. Even when I finally admitted to myself that I have an issue I couldn&rsquo;t quit the habit. The process took <em>years</em> and the recovery is still in progress. Deep down I know that I can fall into the trap anytime again if I&rsquo;m not careful. As I already mentioned, rational measures are ineffective. I couldn&rsquo;t fully address the problem without solving underlying emotional problems. For me that meant a sabbatical and a complete change of circumstances. Once the major problems were taken care of I could watch myself more closely and establish a set of checks to recognize early symptoms and avoid forming an obsession. It is important to recognize the emotional state associated with consumerism to resist it. In my memo have outlined the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Recognize the feeling</em> &mdash; it is an unmistakable rush, with elevated heart rate and total obsession with the purchase. It often feels like the purchase is the last one ever as if I&rsquo;ll be completely set for the future (for who knows what!). It feels like I&rsquo;m incomplete, incompetent, weak without the new thing. Once recognized, following the impulse is a clear weakness and an inability to resist.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Recognize unhealthy minimalism</em> &mdash; there&rsquo;s nothing wrong striving for fewer possessions and simpler living but most of the time for me it means more purchases. Once the one or few small items are sold I dream of something better, &ldquo;more minimal&rdquo;, to replace them with. It is like a purge before the next big wave of purchases.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Postpone purchase for later</em> &mdash; the impulses are unavoidable. What is avoidable is acting on them. That very moment it feels like the new thing is ABSOLUTELY necessary, it makes life simpler, better BUT it&rsquo;s WRONG. It is next to impossible to completely disavow the purchase but scheduling it for future will ensure that the purchase is emotionally cool and not a perverted way of compensating for personal inadequacies.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Emotional purchases as rewards</em> &mdash; some purchases are completely emotional and I know that there&rsquo;s no practical reason for them. That moment I feel like I still want it, like a kind of ornament or jewelery. Then, postpone such purchases as rewards for significant accomplishments. Something, that is far in the future and difficult (completing Iron Man, for example, or completing a difficult project at work).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Eliminate immediate triggers</em> &mdash; whenever the impulse arises it is necessary to avoid any reminders of the new shiny thing. Don&rsquo;t read web articles, reviews, forum posts, auctions or ads. Just accept that you&rsquo;ll get the thing later either as a reward or just simply later. There will be opportunities and sales, especially one year later. You&rsquo;re not losing it and nobody is taking it away so you can relax and stop reading.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In conclusion I think that completely abstaining from any kind of purchase is not healthy either. Certain purchases improve well being and enable opportunities (although honestly very slightly and very seldom). When the mind is not infected with consumerism a purchase is not viewed as desirable but as necessary. When a purchase is needed there&rsquo;s no rush to buy it. It feels I&rsquo;d rather postpone the purchase for as long as necessary or even find a way to do without the new thing. I am happy to report that during the last 6 months I have avoided potential traps and shed more things than I acquired. May further purchases be emotionally cool and the mind clear!</p>

    <link href="http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2016/07/23/farewell-bmw-f800gs-adventure/"/>
    <updated>2016-07-23T19:27:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2016/07/23/farewell-bmw-f800gs-adventure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28495010395"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8479/28495010395_0fe544ede9_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>Yes, my beloved motorbike is gone to another owner. This leaves me with zero motorized vehicles. At the outset of 2016 I have decided to part ways with a BMW F800GS Adventure I had purchased brand new about two years ago. With a little help from my matchmaking the beamer and the new owner successfully found each other and left the garage not to be seen again. I&rsquo;ll keep fond memories of the wonderful spaceship-like machine that enabled <a href="/blog/2015/01/25/motorcycle-adventure-in-norway/">an epic and life-changing 8000Km tour of Northern and Central Europe</a> and left positive emotions. I don&rsquo;t intend to completely quit riding bikes but I have no intentions to own another motorbike in foreseeable future.</p>

<p>The sale came as an indirect consequence of a <a href="/blog/2015/06/16/why-i-have-quit-an-awesome-job/">sabbatical I have taken last year</a>. I had plenty of time to reflect on my ways of living and to reassess whether the things I did brought me joy and contributed to my well-being. In fact, the revelation that I don&rsquo;t actually enjoy motorcycles that much came rushing to me, along with other thoughts, as I was laboriously <a href="/blog/2015/07/10/mountaineering-in-valais/">approaching snow covered peaks</a>. That very moment I became very honest with myself. How many other hobbies and directions was I pursuing that actually left me disengaged? What kept me blind in the face of growing dissatisfaction and emptiness? The inquiry has set me on a path to slash and eliminate everything from my life that&rsquo;s not essential. The many hobbies I had were the first obvious target.</p>

<p>How did I stumble into the world of motorbiking? I was fascinated with bikes and being always told that bikes are dangerous and forbidden by everyone around me set the desire in stone. Plus, the ubiquitous images of fancy bikes and ride reports don&rsquo;t help an impressionable mind running with wild fantasies. I feel these contagious fantasies are often at the root of many misguided pursuits and a heavy weapon in marketing&rsquo;s arsenal. The desire to ride bikes for me came as a desire to become the images I have seen. It was a desire to become something else. And in there lies the problem. It is not the desire to be something or someone but the actual joy of doing that drives positive pursuits. When an activity brings true joy it shouldn&rsquo;t matter what kind of image it invokes. Many non-bikers don&rsquo;t know about &ldquo;waving&rdquo; &ndash; a subtle gesture every motorbiker does when seeing another biker in the opposite lane. The custom immediately makes bikers, especially newcomers, feel part of a club. Seeing other bikers off-the-bike I regularly caught myself thinking that I can&rsquo;t wave and, hence, demonstrate to everyone around that I&rsquo;m also a biker. It almost felt I&rsquo;d like to wear some kind of badge that would make everyone realize I also belong to the club. And the same thought ran through my mind when I was doing one thing but seeing others do something else. Like hiking but seeing mountainbikers. Or touring and seeing road bikers blaze by.</p>

<p>But during the same pivotal mountaineering tour, maybe for the first time in my life, I felt I couldn&rsquo;t care less about other activities I wasn&rsquo;t doing then. It didn&rsquo;t matter anymore if I&rsquo;m perceived &ldquo;correctly&rdquo;. I cared only for what was directly in front of me. And I truly enjoyed the activity for itself. Not for the gear or the popular images of famous climbers or explorers. I think that a dichtonomy for &ldquo;being&rdquo; versus &ldquo;doing&rdquo; fits in nicely. &ldquo;Being&rdquo; is like striving to become something: a motorbiker, a badass climber or an iron-strong athlete. &ldquo;Doing&rdquo;, on the other hand, concerns itself only with the activity itself: riding, climbing or training. &ldquo;Being&rdquo; sets us on an infinite and empty chase for secondary attributes, like possessions, never deeply satisfying. Many an activity in &ldquo;being&rdquo;-mode consists of little but internal complaints and racing thoughts towards the next step or level, whatever that might be. &ldquo;Doing&rdquo;, however, focuses on the activity and nothing else. &ldquo;Being&rdquo; makes one worry if he&rsquo;s doing enough. &ldquo;Doing&rdquo; concerns only with the present &mdash; mastery is gained eventually. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to judge easily if someone is in &ldquo;doing&rdquo; or &ldquo;being&rdquo; mode &mdash; that could only be revealed through honesty with oneself. I&rsquo;m also not saying that ambition and possessions are unnecessary or somehow evil. In fact, it feels great to find oneself in a need of a new shiny thing that could be put into immediate and useful purpose.</p>

<p>Driven mostly by the &ldquo;being&rdquo; outlook I followed a long list of interests, many of which I have since given up. Frankly, some of the pursuits transformed from &ldquo;being&rdquo; into a &ldquo;doing&rdquo; mode, such as hiking/mountaineering and photography. Other hobbies went the way of dodo. And boy, I had lots of those: climbing, mountain biking, road cycling, rc helicopters, motorcycling, weight lifting, wind surfing, not to mention various side projects and pastures I don&rsquo;t recall anymore. Not only were these numerous hobbies unsatisfying but they kept an additional pressure to keep up in all of them. Any free time would be a source of contention and uncertainty &mdash; what should I be doing right now? Should I train mountain biking skills? Should I practice new photography techniques? Am I doing enough of this or that? Motorcycling actually came as a symptom. As a typical weekend approached I would almost never choose to ride a motorbike over riding a bicycle. That was a clear signal that motorcycling is not my thing and that I&rsquo;m knee-deep in unnecessary struggles I produced myself.</p>

<p>I mostly see extraneous hobbies as a distraction from dissatisfaction now. For me personally it came from a disconnect between what I was doing everyday at work and what I would rather be doing. Money buys a lot more distraction than any available time can offer. It&rsquo;s all to easy to fall into a trap of visualizing joy after viewing colorful magazines, website and ads. But no amount of stuff can compensate the emptiness and discontent. I am extremely grateful for an opportunity to stumble upon all these realizations and make a change in my own course. I have just one hobby now and that&rsquo;s triathlon. I came into it through love of cycling and trying my hand, or should I say legs, <a href="/blog/2015/10/31/goals/">at competitive running</a>. How does one find what truly interests him? As contradicting as it may seem but trying out things is the only way to figure out. But it&rsquo;s important not to chase everything at once. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with giving up a hobby and replacing it with another. Indeed, one of joys in the world is its diversity. Finally, there&rsquo;s the attitude &mdash; not to take any of it too seriously. Nobody truly cares about one&rsquo;s interests and pursuits. When something clicks and the activity brings joy everything else will eventually follow &mdash; passion, ambition and, with good fortune, results.</p>

<p>Do I regret the motorbike purchase? Not a bit. I thoroughly enjoyed touring across Europe. Just that one month-long ride was the gateway into my decision to take a sabbatical and change my life. Due to lack of confidence and experience I couldn&rsquo;t stomach renting a bike at the time &mdash; I was certain I will drop it. However, I haven&rsquo;t actually dropped my bike once! I improved significantly as a rider and with many dealerships in Switzerland offering rentals I can now simply grab a bike whenever I fancy without paying out regular expenses associated with ownership.</p>

    <link href="http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2015/10/31/goals/"/>
    <updated>2015-10-31T18:26:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2015/10/31/goals</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>&ldquo;<strong>I FUCKING DID IT</strong>&rdquo; keeps resonating in my head as I am crossing the finish line. I can already feel latent excruciating pain (amplified by an adrenaline-fueled last half-mile sprint) slowly setting in. Few minutes later I won&rsquo;t be able to walk but at this glorious energizing moment I feel that my whole life is coming together.</em></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how successfully finishing a half-marathon felt to me.</p>

<p>In addition, I hereby completely reverse my opinion of life goals. I used to believe that goals are a sick abomination propagated by clouded minds of semi-religious self-improvement cults. I had my reasons. For one, I couldn&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s one supposed to do when goals are fulfilled. And most importantly, I couldn&rsquo;t come up with any (&hellip;that I didn&rsquo;t abandon few days/weeks later).</p>

<p>Well, on a sunny day roughly 11 weeks ago I was walking past an advertisement billboard for an upcoming marathon. My mind was clear of stress and worry, thanks to the elapsed three months of sabbatical. Right there, on the spot, I have decided to run it.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m generally fit and sportive I had never run before. Hell, I have always despised running and especially all kinds of competitive events. I used to repeat a cliché: &ldquo;running is wasted time that could otherwise be spent cycling&rdquo;. Successfully finishing a difficult undertaking like that couldn&rsquo;t be achieved in an instant and there was no way to cheat. The instant gratification was out. I knew it was a long path that required disciplined training.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/22025248504"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5699/22025248504_84a4c75689.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>For the next 10 weeks I adopted a simple training program with 4 runs per week (basically, one of the first results in web search). The distances increased progressively until they winded down few weeks before the race. My first training run was 5km long. I could barely finish it. Thoughts were storming through my mind: &ldquo;how am I supposed to run 21km if 5km is already so difficult&rdquo;. That was my first lesson: don&rsquo;t think about the goal and instead focus on the current step. Every time I trained I focused on finishing just that training, nothing else. Miraculously, I haven&rsquo;t given up once and completed every single training run.</p>

<p>Time went by and the d-day approached. While my mind was calm my body was having some doubts. I could feel an increased heart rate during the days leading to the race. The race took place in Lausanne, French part of Switzerland. The vibe at such events is extremely positive and supportive with both, runners and bystanders, cheering for you.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/22025252164"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/765/22025252164_58a0ba4662.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The first two thirds of the race went steady. I maintaned a sustainable pace by regularly double-checking my speed on a sports watch. I followed my breath, movements and hydration. Not much else was going through my mind. It was systematic and joyful. In fact, I smiled a lot.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/22634485092"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5826/22634485092_9b94d001a9.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/22460088480"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/670/22460088480_499343801b.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>On the 14th kilometer something happened to my left leg. I felt pain in the quad muscle area and began to slow down. The pain was so strong I had to change the way I ran to a very inefficient one. While I lost a minute or more on every kilometer I couldn&rsquo;t imagine facing the intense pain for the last 7 or so kilometers. Even with the new foot strike the pain slowly built up and intensified. I realized that if I stop just for a moment it would be the end of the race. Most likely the legs would swell and I wouldn&rsquo;t resume. So I kept on. Inefficient, painful but persistent. As I got closer to the finish line cheering crowds and music electrified me. Despite the pain I ran faster and faster, approaching a sprinting pace. The joy culminated as I crossed the line. The emotional spike came so strongly to me that I wanted to cry.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/22659237311"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/616/22659237311_8dd3c46841.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what exactly happened to my legs. Almost a week later I am still limping but the pain has mostly subsided. I trained carefully and had plenty of long distance runs. I had sufficient nutrition and hydration. I suppose nobody is exempted from risk at such endurance events, even with the best preparation. Once the pain is fully absent I&rsquo;ll surely be back with new goals in mind.</p>

<p>The experience taught a me a couple of invaluable new lessons as well as cemented a few old ones. Like never before, I believe that lessons from sports are relevant to other areas of life.</p>

<p>First, I came to realize that it&rsquo;s important to strive for the difficult and challenging things. It became immediately obvious to me that in the last couple of years I haven&rsquo;t dreamed big enough and settled for things that were easy to imagine. I tended to favor problems for which I already had an idea in my mind. Half-marathon seemed initially impossible to me which made it a clear practical example of what scale of problems to go after. When something seems almost impossible it&rsquo;s worth going after!</p>

<p>Second, as I had already admitted in the opening, I understood the value of setting life goals. It does not matter what kind of goals to choose initially, as long as they are non-trivial. As life generally doesn&rsquo;t have meaning any arbitrary goal might get one going. The success in one area will prepare you for unrelated challenges. Competitive sports offer a great training opportunity.</p>

<p>Third, there&rsquo;s nothing confusing about what to do when goals are complete. In fact, the finite lifespan of goals is very motivating and energizing. Pain and hardship don&rsquo;t last forever. Once you complete the goal it&rsquo;s over. Enjoy the moment and have some rest. Then, choose and go after a new goal!</p>

<p>Finally, when it&rsquo;s too hard to come up with any good meaningful goals it might be a sign that you are purposefully ignoring and supressing your true interests. At least I found myself in such a situation. All the goals I was coming up with ignored my most prominent ambitions and genuine interests. It was hard to face the reality and acknowledge the potential price to pay. That&rsquo;s how comfort zones shrink. It&rsquo;s a slow but sure way to die inside.</p>

<p>Training for and then running a (half)-marathon is potentially a life changing experience but only when the success comes hard and the mind is fertile and open. It didn&rsquo;t come easy to me and I can&rsquo;t appreciate enough everything I have learned and realized.</p>

<p>I am also indebted for the success of my first race to my beloved wife. Without your support and understanding nothing would come out of it. You have a 20% stake in this achievement!</p>

    <updated>2015-06-16T19:27:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2015/06/16/why-i-have-quit-an-awesome-job</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/18863676532"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3716/18863676532_dd50531ca1_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>I woke up at five in the morning today and headed to the airport with my beloved wife to fly out to celebrate our wedding anniversary on one of the beautiful Greek islands. As I am typing this on my computer during the flight I do not yet fully comprehend that our vacation is not going to end like most vacations do: two weeks later at the office. That is because earlier in May I inked a decision to voluntarily resign from one of the best places to work in the world. Since I made the announcement I have been predominantly asked three questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why are you leaving?</li>
<li>What are you going to do next?</li>
<li>What are you going to do during your break?</li>
</ol>


<p>I would like to share what made me make such a difficult decision. Hopefully, this short reflection helps others in their search of meaning and happiness. Writing also helps me to make sense of my own life and turn ephemeral, and often confusing, thoughts into concrete insights.</p>

<p><strong>tldr;</strong> answers are as follows: to discover my true passion, I don&rsquo;t know for certain, nothing for a while and then prepare for whatever I choose next.</p>

<p>There was nothing rash or sudden in my actions. If anything, I thought about it beforehand obsessively for several years. The balance of scales was finally disturbed last year when I went on a four week motorcycle tour of Norway and Sweden. Time alone on the road did not give many opportunities to think as I was preoccupied with looking for the fun roads, food and places to stay. But reflections, insights and thoughts stormed their way into my mind in the aftermath, as I reached home. Despite the engine roar, the twists and various incidents I felt calm and free during my little adventure. I felt no worry. But upon returning to the daily work routine the contrast was so stark that my hands began to shake. Stress has quickly re-established its elevated residency which I had not ever noticed before the trip. The background stress is toxic to the body but it is difficult to detect, just like the frog can&rsquo;t notice increasingly hot water it&rsquo;s in until the poor creature boils to death.</p>

<p>It is then that it became obvious to me that I must change either my ways of living or my attitude if I want to exist harmoniously and happily. It something easier said in hindsight as there&rsquo;s rarely a clear unambiguous signal to act in our complex entangled lives. History does not exist while the events are still unfolding. Similarly, factors and reasons rarely come together as neatly as they seem in the retrospect. Furthermore, real decisions usually have a steep price to pay and require to give up something valuable in return. I value and cherish many things that my way of living has given me up to the pivotal moment. Few other have had such gifts from the lady fortune. I found it difficult to seek understanding and support as there are few people I know who wouldn&rsquo;t label me a self-entitled ungrateful and wasteful bastard.</p>

<p>Fear is the other force to hold back. Fear held me a prisoner for years. One expects fear to be pretty obvious though I found it anything but. I have some credentials to back up my stance. In the last couple of years I skydived AFF (which means I did the first jump solo, unlike being strapped to another skydiver in a tandem), rode down-hill mountain bike trails, rode a 200 horsepower motorbike around a race track and did some other feats considered scary and risky by (mostly incorrect) common sense. I know what the obvious fear feels like. The fear of change is different: it lies dormant like a crocodile that snaps its deadly claws upon the motion of potential prey. Only in the case of fear the prey is any kind of uncertainty and change. Human nature is soaked with the poison of fear and we don&rsquo;t realize it.</p>

<p>What was I in? By any objective measure I lived in a paradise: being part of one of the best companies in the world that has shaped humanity and will do so in the foreseeable decades. The compensation, perks, free food and amazing office facilities are nothing to complain about. Nor do humane bosses, tolerant atmosphere, intelligent colleagues, space for initiative and considerable freedom to choose what to work on. Yet something has been amiss from the head start: passion. From the moment I started I did not enjoy what I was doing. I struggled initially but over time I learned skills that made me adapt and grow tolerant. I even excelled by the prevailing performance standards. At times there were assignments that got me really excited but 80% of my work felt empty.</p>

<p>I have not spent the time lazily complaining about the circumstances. I used the opportunity to find meaning outside of profession. I tried out more hobbies than I have toes and fingers combined. I studied and worked on side projects and ideas. I devoured in an intimate relationship with my then-girlfriend wife. I traveled. I read ferociously. I went beyond the confines of my nature-given introversion to meet people and make friendships. I pursued spirituality. But there is only so much time in 24 hours. Dealing with work that does not excite saps you of energy and eventually shrinks the energy capacity. I had genuine opportunities at the company to change into a line of work that is closer to my interests but failed to seize them due to unfortunate combination of reasons. By now I have got very little energy left and I definitely couldn&rsquo;t pull two jobs at once which is somewhat a prerequisite for a successful transfer. I don&rsquo;t see how passion can be compensated. I feel that no amount of hobbies, relationships and interests can compensate an occupation that is out of line with one&rsquo;s values and passions.</p>

<p>Despite what the articles and books say discovering passion is not that obvious. The typical premise is to follow one&rsquo;s goals and values but if it was so simple there wouldn&rsquo;t be so many confused and lost souls. Personally, I find the discovery process the most difficult. I don&rsquo;t understand how anyone can know his values and passions without a serious deal of reflection work. I certainly don&rsquo;t believe that one can substitute the hard work with a half an hour exercise. Without trying out various things it&rsquo;s not possible to determine what one is really excited about. Discovering passion is a process of trial and error. Discovery is about exploring further what little we have experienced so far along with finding new turns. It is not unlike navigating a maze.</p>

<p>One serious obstacle to the process of self discovery is the denial of truth. While it&rsquo;s not possible to know what our passions are without trying we can seriously inhibit progress by refusing to pursue our callings. After graduating from university I chose to work outside of my field of interest. To be honest, I wasn&rsquo;t particularly sure what of the many specializations in my field I wanted to pursue either. But ever since I began to work I did not get closer to finding that out. Instead, I thought of hundreds of reasons why pursuing passion isn&rsquo;t worthwhile. With the right financial disincentives failure to ever return on the path of self actualization is almost guaranteed.</p>

<p>It is also puzzling to me why people living in a westernish modern world rarely ever consider taking a long break from work. We live in an era of unprecedented productivity and economic growth. Yet most of us sit chained to our desks for 8-14 hours a day as if we were coal miners of the bygone centuries. It is impossible to perform uninterrupted quality intellectual work for more than a few hours a day. Somehow we conveniently ignore the truth and let our minds rot while we make ourselves look busy and let the hours pass instead of perhaps lifting some weight to make our backs stronger or learning a new skill. Nobody benefits from the idle hours. It&rsquo;s the same with ridiculously short vacations. Two weeks of vacation cannot replenish an exhausted body and mind.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t wait to take a break for too long. If you&rsquo;re not feeling mostly passionate about what you do chances are you will eventually burn out. There&rsquo;s anxiety and depression around the corner and broken relationships and career prospects (who wants under-performers back?). Instead, plan ahead and do it gracefully: go out with a smile and respect, with friendships and good memories. I think I waited a tad too long but at least I did not experience a complete break down. I feel drained professionally but my inner drive is still alive and ready to kick in a high gear after some greasing.</p>

<p>With all of what I have that said, I don&rsquo;t regret the choice I had made years ago. If I had the opportunity to go back in time and make the choice again I would have picked the same option. I believe I made the right decision given the circumstances. I don&rsquo;t blame anyone for the final outcome. If anything, I&rsquo;m grateful to the company, to my bosses and to my colleagues. I strongly believe that the same job could be blissful and highly rewarding under the right mindset and circumstances. I believe life is not meant to be a perfect well rehearsed sequence of &ldquo;nexts&rdquo; and I have very few expectations about the future. Nobody but me has an obligation to make the most out of my life.</p>

<p>Quitting a great job and taking a long break is the most difficult decision I made in my life so far. There&rsquo;s so much I would like to change and to learn and to experience! It&rsquo;s time to recharge, instill new helpful habits and to prepare for whatever I choose as my next challenge.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The bookshelves and the Internet are filled with articles and books containing life-changing ideas. Between fiction, non-fiction, psychology, biographies and self-help literature lies a curriculum unfulfillable in thousands of life times. Many of the ideas have the potential to drastically improve one&rsquo;s life. But there is a world of difference between <em>just agreeing</em> and <em>truly internalizing</em> any one of those ideas. And there&rsquo;s even a wider gap between applying an idea in a safe limited environment versus applying it in a high stakes situation. The former is akin to a sandbox, shielding us from failure and limiting our losses in case of failure. The latter is enshrouded in fear and uncertainty because the potential losses are real, significant and palpable. Though only the latter lets us reap deep benefits and become better selves.</p>

<p>Not only is there a difference between knowing an idea and internalizing idea but there&rsquo;s often no real situation in one&rsquo;s life where that idea could be applied at a given moment. Life-changing ideas are somewhat like tools. To use a tool there must be something to apply it to, a subject. If I suddenly receive an advanced spectroscope I won&rsquo;t have a clue what to do with it. After looking up what a spectroscope is on Wikipedia I&rsquo;ll possibly try to use it to measure something, just to feel good about myself and that I am intelligent enough to figure out how to use it. I&rsquo;ll then put the spectroscope in a box never to be seen again. An astronomer, however, would be glad to have the same tool at his disposal. Unlike me, the astronomer has a real use for the spectroscope. My use of the spectroscope is superficial while the astronomer could use it for a real breakthrough.</p>

<p>It occurred to me recently that getting in trouble is very important for a good lived life. Getting in trouble is the first step of personal growth and improvement in any area. Without trouble there&rsquo;s no use for solutions. Tools are usually created to solve a problem, to get out of trouble. It&rsquo;s not often that a tool is created first and then a use is figured out for it. Literature and media creates an opposite impression. Trouble, problems, inefficiency are portrayed in a negative light. Solutions, ideas, new ways of thinking are then glorified. But in this transition an important aspect is forgotten. Without the trouble in the first place nobody would care about a solution. Two thousand years ago humans could not care less about climate change and improvements to our energy production methods. These improvements are important for our well-being but two thousand years ago there was nothing to apply these improvements to. There was simply no such trouble as environment pollution.</p>

<p>Best-selling manage-everything books similarly portray trouble in negative light and gladly present solutions. For instance, time management books present 1001 strategies on dealing with overburden and stress. But few of the works will take a pause to acknowledge the value of being overburdened in the first place. Being overburdened and stressed means that we have taken on lots of responsibilities. While the situation itself may be undesirable our past courage deserves respect and acknowledgment. If we lied around the house all day and did not do anything at all we would not have these problems! It&rsquo;s not the missing acknowledgment that personally bothers me but the resulting reversal of solutions and problems. I don&rsquo;t need time management advice until I take up too many responsibilities and assignments. When I try to apply all the little tips and strategies I don&rsquo;t need I waste my energy I could have used to actually do something. I also get a false feeling that I am a master of time management. But the reality is that I&rsquo;m no better at time management than I&rsquo;m at astronomy with the spectroscope I had previously been gifted.</p>

<p>My personal take away is to get in trouble more often. I have nothing against reading what the best minds have already figured out. In fact, knowing what exists out there helps when the reality finally confronts with insurmountable obstacles. But I am cautious not to foolishly get enthused about the problems I don&rsquo;t currently have.</p>
