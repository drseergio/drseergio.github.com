    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been sick in and out with all kinds of cold during past several weeks. I had a lucky break last weekend and went for a snowshoe hike in Arosa, Switzerland.</p>

<p>It has been the first time I&rsquo;ve taken the snowshoes on. I had a misconception that snowshoes will let you float on the surface. They won&rsquo;t. After a couple of hours I got a hang of it and could even run. I know I&rsquo;ll be spending time outdoors so I splurged on luxurious MSR ascent snowshoes. These snowshoes have good grip &ndash; I could not slide even if I wanted to.</p>

<p>The hike itself has been rather easy and there was not much snow. However, it has been a good opportunity to get used to the snowshoes.</p>

<p>We have spent the day bathing in sun above a fog that covered most of central Switzerland. On our way back there was a 2 minute opportunity to shoot the fog and the sunset before descending back into fog&rsquo;s vast but short-lived kingdom (we were changing train to bus as the regular train route was blocked by a rockfall).</p>

<p>And this time someone took a photo of me!</p>
