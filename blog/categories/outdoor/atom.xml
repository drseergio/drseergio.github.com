    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week we went to the Grindelwald area for hiking. Getting there wasn&rsquo;t easy &mdash; a relatively long 4-hour train journey each way plus additional delays due to an accident on the tracks. The accidents seem to become common as the same happened the week before. Anyhow, Grindelwald is vast with hiking routes. I&rsquo;ve been to Grindelwald several times before and even stayed overnight once. Our hike wasn&rsquo;t difficult but very pretty.</p>

<p>Day&rsquo;s track on Strava: <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/662251820">https://www.strava.com/activities/662251820</a></p>

<p><em>Total distance walked</em>: 9.6km</p>

<p><em>Vertical ascent</em>: 440m</p>

<p><em>Total time</em>: 3:35:00</p>

<p>The area is quite popular with tourists and especially so on a weekend. Most tourists, though, don&rsquo;t venture too far away from the cable car.</p>

<p>At first we were greeted by friendly cows and mountain goats:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28108365774"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8484/28108365774_a5091538f4.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>Then we arrived at the beautiful Bachsee lake:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28620530572"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8057/28620530572_5cd6def92b.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>From the lake we went higher&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28620533512"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8758/28620533512_ab8c9e4e69.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>and higher&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28441898670"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8175/28441898670_34b87860d6.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>still higher&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28441904920"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8602/28441904920_e59b2bae03.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>Until we climbed over a ridge and began a descent to Bussalp:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28620539932"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8549/28620539932_a60336b493.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The descent was accompanied by drizzling rain and piercing cold wind. We didn&rsquo;t have windproof jackets with us (or any jackets, for that matter) so we caught mild cold in the coming days. However, we were not disappointed with food <a href="/blog/2016/07/20/photo-report-silent-nanztal-valley-crossing/">like the week before</a> &mdash; proper mountain Rösti and our favorite Möhl drink.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past Sunday I hiked a fantastic route together with my wife. It&rsquo;s the first real hike this year and given the busy times it&rsquo;s unsurprising. But it wasn&rsquo;t just the first of a season. It was the most difficult hike my wife has ever completed and I was left totally impressed with her pace and endurance. Not only we walked for more than 15 kilometers but we also climbed almost a thousand vertical meters. For my wife, who normally prefers flat walks along ridges or lakes, it is a considerable accomplishment.</p>

<p>Day&rsquo;s track on Strava: <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/645364892">https://www.strava.com/activities/645364892</a></p>

<p>Inspiration: <a href="http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/silent-nanztal-valley-crossing.html">myswitzerland.com</a></p>

<p><em>Total distance walked</em>: 14.7km</p>

<p><em>Vertical ascent</em>: 968m</p>

<p><em>Total time</em>: 5:35:00</p>

<p>The day started early as we had to make it to one of the most remote places relative to our home. All in all, about 4 hours of public transport to get there. For me it&rsquo;s the second weekend in a row of visiting canton Valais. There was an accident on the train tracks along the route so our arrival was delayed for about an hour which made us understandably cautious given that our way back depended on a chair lift and chair lifts don&rsquo;t run 24/7. Still we sticked to the original plan and started walking.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27778716403"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8896/27778716403_ef72bbbe0e.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>It was scorching hot almost everywhere in Switzerland. One of the benefits of staying at higher altitudes is the cooler weather. There was a pleasant breeze throughout the route.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28112075750"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7775/28112075750_9dac6cbea9.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>Despite the numerous hikes I am still amazed at the scale and the magnificence of mountain landscapes. My mind simply can&rsquo;t grasp the distances. It needs something to put the size into perspective. Nothing gives a better sense than a huge panoramic shot with a tiny human silhouette somewhere in the picture.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28394972325"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8791/28394972325_76349c7ed7_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>For the first time ever we brought trekking poles with us. They were a real boon for my wife. Sadly I&rsquo;ve got none of that as we own just one pair. The poles provided significant support on the way up as well as on the way down. I see now that trekking poles allow us to take more challenging routes. The tactical advantage also evens out our walking paces. Perhaps we could rely on the same strategy for future difficult hikes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28290462142"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8718/28290462142_54c8aa0547.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27778755273"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8595/27778755273_2ac31ec0e2_z.jpg" width="427"></a></p>

<p>Closer to the end of the hike we stumbled into a herd of cows.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28290496852"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8176/28290496852_10f6070427.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27778226974"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8213/27778226974_d863c73e84.jpg" width="333"></a></p>

<p>I dislike walking fast. When I was much younger I had a tendency to walk so fast that I almost ran. It took me years of deliberate practice to get away from it. It feels great to walk slow and to contemplate the present instead of racing towards yet another passing thing. Still, it&rsquo;s important to keep planned estimates and actual walking speeds in mind. Astonishingly, we have finished quicker than the official signposts suggested! For our dynamic duo it&rsquo;s a remarkable achievement given that we normally arrive 1-2 hours later than any kind of estimate.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28112148850"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8877/28112148850_633a7a517b_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>The arrival at the chair lift was disappointing to say the least. We were looking forward to eat a typical mountain Rosti but the kitchen in the restaurant at the lift was already closed. We had no other choice but to scout for food upon descending into the valley. In any case, it was yet another great day in the mountains!</p>

    <link href="http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2016/07/16/first-4000m-climb/"/>
    <updated>2016-07-16T08:34:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2016/07/16/first-4000m-climb</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am not a peak collector by any stretch of imagination. Indeed I avoid &ldquo;the best&rdquo; like plague. I leave &ldquo;the best&rdquo; for the unsuspecting tourist crowds and boastful blabbers. But the fact is that I&rsquo;ve climbed to the highest altitude in my life. And I&rsquo;ve already paid my dues by feeling the wrath of Gods &mdash; reaching the peak left me untouched and the corresponding up-and-down motions were anything but mindful. Yet the purpose of this 2-day mountaineering trip has been fulfilled &mdash; I am now <em>formally</em> skilled in the basic skills of alpine walking and climbing.</p>

<p>Ever since my <a href="/blog/2015/07/10/mountaineering-in-valais/">first true alpine adventure last year</a> the pasture of trekking mountains and glaciers attracted me. I have not gone crazy about it and I don&rsquo;t currently have ambitions to get exceedingly great at it. Instead, hiking and mountaineering remain for me a gateway into a state of mind where little matters beyond what&rsquo;s immediately in front of me. I don&rsquo;t care about having the best gear. I also don&rsquo;t care about perceived challenge of this or that route. And I&rsquo;m definitely not going to train for it, say, by attending a climbing wall regularly.</p>

<p>With that said when I saw an opportunity to attend a 2-day mountaineering tour at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SwissAlpineAdventure/">SwissAlpineAdventure</a> aimed at educating beginners I couldn&rsquo;t pass. A little bit of structured knowledge and training couldn&rsquo;t hurt. The tour brought me back to region of Valais. Our starting point was the town of Saas Fe. The planned itinerary was not difficult. The goal of the first day was to get acquainted with the basics in a sandbox environment and then ascend Allalinhorn (4027m) the following day.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28184032622"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8741/28184032622_23699b3cbf_m.jpg" width="240"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27672040364"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8688/27672040364_482b6ed4b2_m.jpg" width="240"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28184048972"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8745/28184048972_a7d3ce3ec7_m.jpg" width="240"></a></p>

<p>This is how our movements looked like:</p>

<li>Day 1 track: <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/642367091">https://www.strava.com/activities/642367091</a></li>
<li>Day 2 track: <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/642368714">https://www.strava.com/activities/642368714</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Our schedule was generous with late starts, plenty of idle time and lots of help from lifts and cable cars. We didn&rsquo;t come up all the way from the valley. Instead we arrived by cable car to Felskinn station (3000m):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27672071334"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7313/27672071334_89dbebae5b_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>The way from the station to the <a href="http://www.britannia.ch/">Britannia hut</a> (3030m) was a short and mild stretch of slushing through snow. Our guide from <a href="http://www.bergundtal.ch/">bergundtal</a> Stephane Tuni engaged us regularly by educating about the hiding dangers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27672389023"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8597/27672389023_93b0741595.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a baby peak Klein Allalin (3070m) opposite the Britannia hut which we have used throughout the first day to practice. We learned how to correctly hold the axe, how to tie the ropes and how to safely walk with crampons.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28209634331"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8576/28209634331_6e4a49b05d.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28209631481"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7062/28209631481_d9eef0a8c8.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The views from Klein Allalin are grand:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28209622501"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7712/28209622501_1e7956d0d2_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28253906596"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8625/28253906596_86403bccd1.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>Seeing Ilya on this tour was a true serendipitous encounter. We haven&rsquo;t coordinated our participation. It just happened by chance. Ilya rightly complained about a recent trip to our beloved outdoor gear shop Transa and how much it cost him. I can relate easily as I&rsquo;ve done that trip last year. Right now I&rsquo;m all set with the gear.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28184107462"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8671/28184107462_8d34f89268.jpg" width="333"></a></p>

<p>The Britannia hut is relatively large and quite modern. I admit I&rsquo;m spoiled by great huts. Last year&rsquo;s trek was accompanied by huts that were as good and as modern. The hut is situated close to the cable-car station so it attracts a lot of visitors, especially during a weekend. It feels more like a hostel that just happpened to be in mountains. It was packed.</p>

<p>Knowing that I wouldn&rsquo;t fall asleep easily I decided to take a tripod with me and stay on Klein Allalinhorn until it gets dark to see the stars. The sky was relatively clear.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28288171755"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8862/28288171755_3c9cc512a8_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27672137354"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7704/27672137354_ef13a732b7_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I did not stay long enough to make worthwhile pictures of a starry night but I enjoyed the sight myself. Fantastic. When the complete darkness fell upon the mountains I felt a bit uncomfortable. Movements behind my back stirred alertness. A running marmot was the final drop on my nerves so I decided to get back to the hut and sit on a bench, marvelling at the sight.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28288177805"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8598/28288177805_472acd0af9_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>My predictions about inability to sleep came true. I could hardly sleep that night with so many people in the room. Perhaps there was also part of altitude difference playing its role. In any case we got up relatively late at 5am to have breakfast and left the hut at about 6am.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28253929596"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8651/28253929596_07c62879ac_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>There was no rush as we were going to take a lift to Mittelallalin (3457m) station and walk from there. As it turned out, the lift opened later that we had expected so we had to wait. Furthemore, the Metro Alpin lift broke down. We waited in suspension hoping for the best. Fortunately, the team of mechanics departed with a helicopter and all technical problems were adressed in a couple of hours. Since our plans had sufficient slack even a significant delay like this didn&rsquo;t prevent us from completing the tour.</p>

<p>After the ride with the lift the tour turned bitter. Especially on the way down. I found the way to the summit and back uncomfortably fast. At times I felt that the rope is pulling me forward, dragging the ground from underneat my feet. I still don&rsquo;t understand why we had to rush so much. There were also too many other groups on the way. These two factors somewhat spoiled the atmosphere. The tour didn&rsquo;t feel good anymore. It felt like we were a tourist group shown around a popular sight somewhere in a middle of a large city.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27672491473"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8637/27672491473_8d76450ce6_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>Reaching the summit did not feel anything special. It was not deserved &mdash; we cheated our way through cable cars and lifts. And there were so many other folks!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27672185304"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8742/27672185304_c2567bf916.jpg" width="333"></a></p>

<p>Our crew at the summit:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/28006658860"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8597/28006658860_19a702d00b.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d like to visit such popular peaks again, especially during a busy time like the weekend. I am also not sure about going with groups of people I haven&rsquo;t met before. It&rsquo;s certainly nice to meet new people but I think I prefer to go with the people I already know and trust. Despite certain mental dissatisfaction I&rsquo;m already signed-up for a follow-up trip in August. Let&rsquo;s hope we&rsquo;ll avoid some of the issues.</p>

    <link href="http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2016/05/30/samaria-gorge-hike/"/>
    <updated>2016-05-30T21:29:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2016/05/30/samaria-gorge-hike</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Exactly two weeks ago I thought I was exhausted from preparing for job interviews (I will write a separate post explaining my study strategy). After all, I have been averaging 6-8 hours of algorithms and Java study almost every day for 2 months (I am switching careers and going full-time in software engineering). In reality, it was a virus that caused physical break-down, an eye infection and fever. In what can be described as the most spontaneous decision of my life I decided we need to take a short break and go to the sea. How spontaneous? I felt debilitating headache Monday morning and we flew out on Wednesday.</p>

<p>So we chose a destination we could fly to ASAP that had decent weather and warm sea. In the end we went to Crete. I had previously visited Crete 10 years ago. Crete left an impression not only with the warm Mediterranean climate and usual resort-world bells and whistles but also with a natural wonder I couldn&rsquo;t visit at the time. I&rsquo;m talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samari%C3%A1_Gorge">Samaria Gorge</a>. It was time to finally hike it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26720077554"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7444/26720077554_8d954f1239_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>I am amazed at how the local businesses managed to market and sell Samaria Gorge and lull even the most unprepared unfit tourists, making it a must-visit attraction. In the high season, which unsurprisingly is the worst time of the year to visit it, Samaria Gorge attracts 30,000-40,000 tourists per month. Some of those tourists later write horror stories as to how difficult and extreme the whole experience was. Legends get born and rumors get spread.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m here to bust some myths. First of all, it is not the largest Gorge in Europe. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdon_Gorge">Verdon Gorge</a> is. Second, it is not an extremely difficult adventure. It&rsquo;s best described as a hike of medium-easy difficulty. Most of the time the route descends which is admittedly not my favorite (I prefer ascents or mixed terrain). While the terrain is rocky there is nothing extreme about it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26720813773"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7251/26720813773_bb58db0b87_n.jpg" width="213"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27052274170"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7653/27052274170_654d0d72a3_n.jpg" width="213"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27257029391"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7006/27257029391_246c4a35bb_n.jpg" width="213"></a></p>

<p>In terms of gear the hike requires mostly decent shoes. I brought the most minimal and lightweight shoes I own and they were just fine. Apparently the overly successful marketing attracts unsuspecting couch potatoes in flip-flops but I haven&rsquo;t spotted a single person whose clothing stood out as outlandlishly inadequate.</p>

<p>Without any strain we completed the walk in 5:45. We took lots of pictures and made one stop for packed breakfast in the old Samaria village which is in the middle of the route. My watch counted 20Km but I suspect that&rsquo;s due to errors due to poor sky visibility in the gorge. Officially, the total distance from the park entrance to the beach is approximately 17Km. Sounds realistic.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/590696789">View our GPS track on Strava</a></p>

<p>End of May is a fantastic time to visit it because the gorge is full of life: vegetation and flowers. Most importantly, it is not scorching hot. I find that the scenery becomes interesting after the Samaria village, roughly 8-10Km into the hike. The first half is similar to a walk in a park and it&rsquo;s not possible to see much of the gorge. But the actual gorge looks breathtaking.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27230250722"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7349/27230250722_01d870f748_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>In fact, I would consider visiting the park in the opposite direction: arriving by ship at the end of the route in the morning, exploring the gorge area up to the Samaria village and taking the ship back. It&rsquo;s possible to pull this off with a rental car by keeping it in the town from where the ship departs.</p>

<p>Speaking of transportation it&rsquo;s not great. There are only 3 ships per day: 2 in the morning and only one in the afternoon at 17:30. Those who finish reasonably at about 14:00-15:00 are doomed to stay in the area. Admittedly, the area ain&rsquo;t bad and the beach is completely worth a visit. In case somebody doesn&rsquo;t make it to the ship there are plenty of rooms available for rent.</p>

<p>We chose to get to the park and back by taxi. The price is not unreasonable if staying near city of Chania. For us, the higher taxi price was worth extra hours in the morning and in the evening. A tourist bus takes longer because it needs to pick-up tourists from various hotels.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re visiting Crete pack a pair of shoes &mdash; the gorge is worth a visit!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another year, another <a href="http://rigimarsch.ch/">Rigimarsch</a>! <a href="/blog/2015/05/24/longest-non-stop-hike-in-my-life/">Last year</a> I&rsquo;ve participated in an annual night hike up to the Rigi mountain. It was a tough yet exhilerating experience. This year I&rsquo;ve repeated the challenge together with John.</p>

<p>The route was the same as always: 50 or so kilometers with a 1500m ascent in the last 10 kilometeres. However, the hike felt refreshingly different.</p>

<p>For me personally the hike was a test for the healing Tibia bone that fractured during last year&rsquo;s <a href="/blog/2015/10/31/goals/">half-marathon in Lausanne</a> (I ran 1/3 of the marathon with a fractured bone).</p>

<p>John looks cheerful but everybody is cheerful at the start:</p>

<p>According to the official information a record 2363 people turned up for the event. Despite the crowd the registration went smoothly. We started walking at around 20:00.</p>

<p>The Rigi mountain. It is intimidating to see the peak far ahead throughout the hike:</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s Rigimarsch took place on May 4th which is relatively early, compared to previous and future years. The event date is tied to Ascension day. Thanks to the early start there was plenty of snow at the top and the night temperatures were quite cool. I wore every piece of clothing I brought along.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26655268824"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7360/26655268824_c98e764931.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I felt energized and positive even in the last hours of the challenge. This is a huge departure from last year&rsquo;s impression. I still vividly recall just how difficult last few hours were. I think several factors are at play. First, I&rsquo;m in much better physical shape for aerobic activities because I switched from weight lifting to triathlon. Second, we brought trekking poles with us for the ascent. Finally, I came to the hike completely rested and fresh.</p>

<p>John is still smiling at the top, that&rsquo;s the way to do it:</p>

<p>Return train from Rigi to Arth-Goldau. There were enough places in the train for everyone to take a seat:</p>

<p>The hike took us about 12 hours to complete which is almost the same as last year. However, our moving time is a whole hour shorter which means we walked measurably faster but took longer breaks.</p>
