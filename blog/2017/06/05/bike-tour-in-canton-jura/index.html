        <p>Summer 2017 is off to a great start! I&rsquo;ve been using every opportunity to get out and ride. Over the past few weeks I&rsquo;ve managed to squeeze in 3 Uetliberg ascents / descents (with one over-the-handlebars crash), regular rides with the Zurich/Zug peloton group as well as other local rides. Last Thursday was a holiday so I took Friday off and made a long weekend to make the best out of the great weather. I cycled through canton Jura (rather a part of it) in 2 days. Jura is beautiful! And the tour turned out to be quite difficult&hellip;</p>

<img src="/images/jura_route.jpg" />



<p></p>

<p>The original plan was to follow <a href="http://www.veloland.ch/en/routes/route-07.html">Swiss National Route 7</a> and complete it in 2 days. The overall length of Route 7 is 280km. The route consists of 6 stages. I completed the first 3 stages on day 1 but changed the direction on day 2. Instead of going to Nyon I headed to Yverdon-les-Bains and then to Neuchatel. There was just too much climbing left on day 2 for my exhausted body.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m genuinely happy when my bike is prepped for the ride and the gear is all packed up:
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/34954143222"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4267/34954143222_957d090ce5.jpg" width="500" />

</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1010283830">Day 1</a>: Total distance 129.6km, 2646m of climbing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1010285228">Day 2</a>: Total distance: 124.8km, 1482m of climbing. Max speed (!) 90kmh (perhaps it&rsquo;s a measurement mistake but possible).</p>

<p>The route started in Basel. Getting to Basel from Zurich is just one train away. Luckily, the train had a separate wagon just for cyclists. How cool is that?! There are plenty of bikers en route early in the morning:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/34954153452"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4286/34954153452_bbe0c7e854.jpg" width="500" />

</a></p>

<p>All of them hurrying and unpacking their stuff at the train station (note the bikers also on the escalator):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/34954158422"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4264/34954158422_231d86278b.jpg" width="500" />

</a></p>

<h3 id="canton-jura-in-five-sentenc-es">Canton Jura, in five.sentenc.es</h3>

<p>Jura feels distinct. Landscapes remind me of central France. There are plenty of fields and forests. The wind, unfortunately, also comes with the open spaces. Jura is a big departure from the alpine central Switzerland.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/35079088806"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4273/35079088806_5fe1728791.jpg" width="500" />

</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/35079103836"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4230/35079103836_1909cfd23d.jpg" width="500" />

</a></p>

<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>

<p>Unlike central France, Jura has plenty of steep hills to go with the lush green pastures:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/35079130706"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4290/35079130706_b56667819c_c.jpg" width="800" />

</a></p>

<p>Love them or hate them, I find climbs extremely rewarding. Most climbs still don&rsquo;t come easy for me but the breathtaking high-speed descents are worth every meter of challenging uphill battles. According to Strava, I have managed to reach 90kmh on day 2. It is possible that&rsquo;s a measurement mistake but on the other hand I find it plausible. I was on a <a href="/blog/2015/09/03/salsa-fargo-rohloff/">heavy steel tank</a>, after all. That thing accelerates like a huge rock falling of a cliff.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the scenery and the route 7. There wasn&rsquo;t much motorized traffic on the roads, except for an occasional motorcyclist cohort with their obnoxiously loud pipes (<em>how could I ever consider such an upgrade for my own motorcycle &ndash; what was I thinking???</em>).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/35079115226"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4259/35079115226_2ba48417a3_c.jpg" width="800" />

</a></p>

<p>The picture below, by the way, is not of some exotic island shoreline somewhere in the Ocean &ndash; it is Switzerland, folks:</p>

</a></p>

<p>Before I began suffering from various pain points I really got into the &ldquo;touring zone&rdquo; and could quietly contemplate the joys of being on the open road.</p>

<h3 id="pain-points">Pain points</h3>

<p>Few rides are completely devoid of shortcomings. This tour could have fewer of them&hellip;</p>

<p>Ass. No way around it. It hurt. A lot. I should have used the chamois cream but for some reason I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t experience the problem. How mistaken I was! I had suffered immensely because of it. I also plan on re-installing the suspension seat post. Comfort is important on long tours and this was just a 2 day ride! I should stop making the same mistake every year. That&rsquo;s it &ndash; 2017 is the last year I suffer from chaffing. Mark my words!</p>

<p>Wrist. I recently crashed on a down-hill trail in Uetliberg, landing on my right wrist. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve broken any bones but the recovery is slow. After a day of riding I could feel every road bump reverberating in my wrist. I hope it gets better or else I&rsquo;ll have to ride exclusively in aero position on aerobars.</p>

<p>Hay fever. I hoped it wouldn&rsquo;t strike me this year (it didn&rsquo;t last year) but by the end of day I was sneezing all over the place and scratching my itchy eyes. It also gave me headache.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/34732231660"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4268/34732231660_20c2cbdf23.jpg" width="500" />

</a></p>

<p>No companion. I was alone on this tour and I really missed John with whom I toured extensively before. I&rsquo;m not the kind of person who can&rsquo;t stay peaceful and joyful alone but riding bikes alone makes me ride too fast too soon so I end up exhausted and irritated. It&rsquo;s much better to ride with a good friend. Then there&rsquo;s plenty of time for great conversations and shared experiences.</p>

<p>Too difficult for a first long ride. The tour was a tad too much for opening the season. It wasn&rsquo;t crazy long (although, admittedly, it was a record total ascent for me) but it could have been a little less ambitious. I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more then. At the moment I estimate my current optimal distance per day for a long-term tour at 100km with no more than 1000m of vertical climbing. Anything significantly longer and/or higher requires longer recovery and is likely unsustainable for more than a few days. Let&rsquo;s see how this estimate changes in future&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="the-bike">The bike</h3>

<p>The bike served well. I had some ideas about buying a frame with <a href="http://www.sandsmachine.com/">S&amp;S couplers</a> (to make the frame break apart) to simplify travel with the bike. I&rsquo;m retiring the idea for now because the overall solution costs too much (estimated at 3500+ EUR) without sufficient value in return (admittedly, for <strong>me</strong>). Financially, I would need to travel at least 10 times on the plane to make up for the total cost of upgrades (or even more for a complete new bike). In addition, a fellow biker said he doesn&rsquo;t always pay an extra fee &ndash; sometimes the bike goes in just like checked-in luggage. That makes the financial argument even more moot.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/34274408234"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4284/34274408234_fa59b60e90.jpg" width="500" />

</a></p>

<p>In any case, I don&rsquo;t travel abroad so often and when I do I&rsquo;d rather rent a fancy road bike for local rides. I&rsquo;m not currently a globetrotter and I don&rsquo;t plan on becoming one in foreseeable future. The convience aspect of S&amp;S couplers is also debatable. The bike needs to be almost completely disassembled and reassembled. I currently have two bike bags: one Evoc for checked-in air travel (never used, purchased on a sale) and one for local/train travel. I think I&rsquo;d rather pay an airline fee the few times I take my own bike with me than build/buy a superexpensive new bike. If anyone is thinking of a present for me, however, I&rsquo;ll gladly accept one as a gift!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still amazed at how good the bike works. Rohloff makes almost no noise. I should, however, urgently take care of Rohloff maintenance before the hub seizes for good. I noticed gear changes didn&rsquo;t come as easy as they normally do. The hub should be serviced (oil change) every 5000km or every year, whatever comes first. I already bought the oil change kit and I&rsquo;ll do it before the next ride.</p>

<h3 id="what-s-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h3>

<p>I seize opportunities whenever they arise without planning too much for future. Seems to work better than the other way around. Next weekend I&rsquo;m off to my first-every bicycle race. It&rsquo;s a team triathlon relay race and I&rsquo;m doing the bike leg. I have been training for it but I feel nervous because I don&rsquo;t want to let my team mates down. I hope for the best but in the worst case expect <a href="/blog/2017/05/04/fail/">another &ldquo;Fail&rdquo; post&hellip;</a></p>
