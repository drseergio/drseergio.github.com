<time datetime="2014-12-03T13:50:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 3<span>rd</span>, 2014</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>2014 is a pivotal year in my cycling &ldquo;career&rdquo;. I went on my first multi-day tour. I went on my first multi-week tour.
I&rsquo;ve set a personal distance record. And I&rsquo;ve set a personal vertical ascent record. Admittedly, I did not do the best job
documenting and sharing. But I digress.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May 2014 me and a 4 friends from work embarked on a biking trip from Andermatt, Switzerland, to Rotterdam, Netherlands,
along the river Rhine. The total planned length of the route was about 1,400 Km. What followed was an example from the book on how
to NOT do bicycle touring. Despite the setbacks I enjoyed the experience and, if anything, it made me stronger and better prepared
for the future tours.</p>

<p>Most of what I have written applies to touring in Europe. Some of the points don&rsquo;t apply to remote and exotic places.</p>

<h2>1. On expectations</h2>

<p>Never being in a long bike tour before I did not know what to expect. Media of our day emphasizes results and achievements and
almost never talks about the mundane, the boring and the unexciting. Basically, we hear and talk about the &lt;1% of things
(likely, &lt;0.0001%). Extending this to bike touring makes us imagine ourself covering insane distances in the most severe
conditions and coming out of it as heroes. The reality is that it&rsquo;s not glamorous and the result does not matter. HOW one rides,
I argue, is more important than reaching some arbitrary target. I argue that a team that exceeds their goal but looses few teammates
along the way due to poor preparation or poor judgment constitutes a failure.</p>

<p>I wish I could be excused for the absent mindedness I had. I held wrong ideas about mindfulness and enjoyment of the present. None of
these obviate the need for excruciating planning and preparations. I must stop immediately if I ever find myself romanticizing
any serious undertakings again.</p>

<p>With that said, let&rsquo;s get down to business.</p>

<h2>2. Planning is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility</h2>

<p>Someone must take the responsibility for planning but every member of the team must review and understand most of the plans. Our biggest
issue was incorrect distance estimation. We calculated distances using Google Maps that chose the shortest cycling paths instead of the
specific route that we intended to follow. We had to ride 25-50% more than originally planned almost every day. Yes, it was cool to cover 208Km in
one day but it was uncool to have team mates regularly getting off the route to take rest and catch-up on trains. The original plan was
simply unrealistic. 2 out of 5 finished, albeit few days later. 1 out of 5 finished from start to finish without getting off the route.</p>

<p>Next time, I&rsquo;m going to breathe our plans. I&rsquo;m going to go through every day, through every kilometer, through every vertical meter.</p>

<h2>3. Unload &frac12; or more of gear</h2>

<p>Seriously. Don&rsquo;t take any food. Buy it at the supermarket in the morning. Don&rsquo;t take extra clothes beyond bare minimum. You don&rsquo;t need
everyday clothes to walk around towns. Combine layers and functional clothing to adapt to changing weather conditions.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t carry extra heavy bike locks. There&rsquo;s no need for any electronics, such as tablets, laptops and DSLRs. Because you are riding,
and not browsing the web or making studio shots. Your smartphone is sufficient for most tasks. Perhaps take an external battery
but that&rsquo;s about it.</p>

<p>I had no problem lugging lots of weight around but it felt inelegant and wasteful. I actually sent 10Kg worth of gear by post on the
second day of the tour.</p>

<p>Also, try to leverage your team. If, after all, you find a need to carry a laptop or a DSLR share the load and don&rsquo;t take multiples.
Share the weight between members.</p>

<h2>4. Choose small substitutes and tiny packages</h2>

<p>It may be ridiculous to buy miniature bottles of shampoo that cost as much as large ones. But it&rsquo;s also ridiculous to carry 0.5-1Kg of
shampoo for the sake of using few grams. And it&rsquo;s possible to get miniature containers for free or cheaply.</p>

<p>I also found that soap is good enough for all my washing needs for the duration of the tour. Not only can I take a shower but I also
have something to wash my bike with! And, best of all, it&rsquo;s small and compact.</p>

<h2>5. Mechanical failures to be expected</h2>

<p>If you never had mechanical failures and you think it&rsquo;s something others are going to experience I have bad news. In a long tour, and especially
in larger groups, failures are more likely to occur. You personally might not have any major break-downs but your team mate might. So the
team must be prepared to fix simple problems on the go and to improvise short-term solutions to get to the next bike shop for more serious
issues.</p>

<p>We had chain failures and flats. My bike&rsquo;s frame failed to hold the rack mounts properly. On the second day of the tour the rack tore off
the thread it was attached to between the seat stays. I was able to cleverly attach the rack with 3 zip ties. It worked surprisingly well
and lasted through the remainder of the tour.</p>

<p>Two weeks of consecutive cycling also puts stress on some parts. For example, brake pads on some of the bikes were gone following couple of
days of prolonged descents. I had mechanical disc brakes and by the end of the tour the pads were so far from the rotors that the bike had
zero stopping power. Knowing how to make basic adjustments is very important.</p>

<h2>6. Don&rsquo;t ride a new bike &hellip;and be prepared when you do</h2>

<p>It is better to take a trusted bicycle you have extensively ridden before, preferably hard. It&rsquo;s difficult to resist a shiny a new bike and
I did exactly this mistake. Instead of riding the bike I had for 3 years I chose to build a new custom one from parts. Obviously, I could not
resist the temptation of the new fancy drop-bar bike.</p>

<p>When you take a new a bike for a tour be prepared to deal with adjustments to gears, brakes and seating position (more on that later). Furthermore,
loose bolts and poorly-placed accessories will make themselves known very quickly. My brakes were not bedded in, the cables were not stretched
and there was a huge risk with a lightweight kick-stand that attached to the rear quick-release skewer. The kick-stand unscrewed the rear wheel
slowly so hypothetically the wheel could go off while I was in a fast descent.</p>

<p>If you decide to take a new machine for the ride then go for a couple of longish test rides, preferably with sufficient ascents and descents
and with the full gear on (e.g. racks with panniers loaded with weight).</p>

<h2>7. Comfort is likely going to play larger role than your fitness</h2>

<p>I was well aware of this one. Most blogs and magazines about touring say that the comfort is the number one reason riders pause their tours and
take breaks. After a couple of 150-200KM days any comfort and ergonomics issues surface quickly. Here&rsquo;s a collective list (of which I experienced
almost all):</p>

<ul>
<li>knee pain due to wrong saddle height</li>
<li>swollen heel due to incorrect fore/aft position</li>
<li>hand numbness (that persisted for several months after the tour)</li>
<li>butt pain</li>
</ul>


<p>Many of these issues will not make themselves known in day rides. I have done 150-180KM rides on a setup similar to what I rode in the tour and
felt no pain or discomfort. But 5 consecutive days of 150KM-180KM rides exposed a whole gamut of issues.</p>

<p>I believe this one is hard to prepare for. My current bike is setup much more ergonomically and I believe I will not experience the same issues
should I go on the exact same route. My recipe: a better seat (Brooks C17), a suspended seat post (Ergon CF-3 or Cane Creek ST) and a suspension
fork (RockShox Reba 100mm).</p>

<h2>8. Carry spares</h2>

<p>Things break and wear out. At a minimum I recommend having: tubes, zip ties, electric tape, a chain, chain links, shift cable, break cable, disc
rotor and break pads. Obviously, a set of tools is required to be able to install the spares, should something break.</p>

<p>Most of my team mates were oblivious to the possibility of things breaking down. Right up to the second day when a chain got torn apart on one of the
bikes.</p>

<p>This is a bigger issue for tours destined to exotic and remote places. While bike shops are on every corner in Europe getting assistance and spares
for fancy bike components could be problematic in, say, Africa. It may be a good idea to ride a bike with simpler and popular parts when going really
far.</p>

<h2>9. Plan sensible distances</h2>

<p>Plan distances rationally. On a flat surface 120-140KM is a reasonable distance to cover in one day. Perhaps even less if you would like to have
any time for something but cycling.</p>

<p>Detours quickly add up. It was not uncommon to have 20-30KM extra due to detours, either because of road closures or navigation mistakes.</p>

<h2>10. Plan for &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; days</h2>

<p>Cycling non-stop for 7+ days is exhausting. Our bodies need rest. If we keep riding hard and far every day we&rsquo;ll come late, wake up later and then
arrive even later the day after. It&rsquo;s a vicious cycle of mental and physical depletion. To avoid a break down it&rsquo;s essential to plan for &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo;
or &ldquo;no cycle&rdquo; days. It could be a good day to spend on a beach, forest, camp, lake, SPA, city center or anything you fancy. Just don&rsquo;t bike. Sleep
and eat a lot.</p>

<p>If possible, try to make the plans flexible to accommodate &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; days when you need them the most.</p>

<p>We had 0 breaks planned. And it showed. On 8th day me and another team mate had a break-down. We rode for 160km that day through storms and arrived
at 10pm in one of the worst places I ever had stay in. We finished our dinner at midnight. Our clothes were dirty and wet and there was absolutely
no energy to do anything. The only way we could finish our tour in time was to wake up and leave at 4am and cycle for 2 more days, 200KM each. Needless
to say, that was the end of the tour for me and another mate. The other guys took extra days to reach the destination.</p>

<h2>11. Getting the difficulty curve right</h2>

<p>We made a mistake of planning too little for our first days. It seemed reasonable to us to leave the first couple of days to ramp up. Well, we had 2
days where we arrived at 4pm and then tried to find something to amuse ourselves with. Some went as far as doing nothing but playing with their tablets
in the comfort of the accommodation.</p>

<p>Compare this to the days that followed: arriving exhausted at midnight after having cycled for 160-180KM. It makes more sense to push a little more
while you are fresh. This goes hand in hand with the previous insight. It&rsquo;s crucial to get the rhythm right.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Switzerland-Germany-Denmark-Sweden-Norway-Latvia-Lithuania-Poland-Czech-Germany-Switzerland, day T-1!</p>

<p>Phew, that was a mouthful. Tomorrow I am leaving for a 4 week motorcycle tour across Europe heading to the North. Every summer for the past couple of years I was swearing that next year I am going to be somewhere North, rather than elbowing annoying tourists in the Southern honeypot tourist traps. Finally, I am doing it!</p>

<p>I have been dreaming of this trip for years. I am not going to lie and say that I planned this trip in detail. I feel quite unprepared and I did very little preparation. I don&rsquo;t have a specific plan in mind and I have not booked any accommodation in advance (with a few notable exceptions). My dear wife has kindly written a whole tour book for me with a collection of interesting places to visit, route suggestions and tips. She currently knows a lot more about my adventure than me. She is not enthused with sleeping in a tent and sitting on a bike for hours at a time so I am doing this trip alone. I will meet her on my way back and we&rsquo;re going to spend time together doing comfortable stuff, like visiting SPAs and staying at fancy hotels. To each his own!</p>

<p>Today is a public holiday and Switzerland. I am packing today. I am going to leave tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>I woke up with a hang-over from yesterday&rsquo;s corporate summer party and an allergic reaction to all the plant shit that&rsquo;s flying around. I pack slowly and sometimes I just sit for 10 minutes doing nothing. Not the best of starts.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the preparation war room looks like at the moment:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/14112675638/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3819/14112675638_e90c558520.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/14112678518/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5513/14112678518_7dc49def62.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I am packing everything into two BMW side aluminum panniers and a 80L backpack strapped on top of the panniers. Combined, the volume of panniers is 80L. I also have a tank bag which I am going to use for valuables and gadgets.</p>

<p>My red beauty:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/14299339415/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5573/14299339415_1d149cbba0.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/14112636139/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5590/14112636139_e052f4c5cd.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/14276196936/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3666/14276196936_be5262cf7e.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The bike is brand new and just out of its first 1000km service. I consider myself somewhat of a newbie rider and I don&rsquo;t have vast riding experience. This does not hold me back.</p>

<p>Tank bag with ingenious charging solution. My bike provides a power outlet for plugging in accessories. By scouting forums and eBay I found a cool adapter that plugs into the outlet and provides two car cigarette sockets. Then I&rsquo;ve plugged two high-power 2-port USB chargers into the sockets. I can charge 4 devices at a time while on the go! I also found a cigarette charger for my laptop which means I am completely self-sufficient with the power.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/14295984991/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3830/14295984991_38c2993b20.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I am going to keep a trip journal but I am not going to update the blog while riding.</p>

<p>I briefly mentioned in one of the previous posts that I am building this bike specifically for touring around Switzerland and Europe. Together with a couple of colleagues we went on a bike tour from Andermatt, Switzerland to Rotterdam, Netherlands along the Rhine river. I&rsquo;ll be covering the tour separately in a series of posts. In this post, however, I would like to share lessons learned from the building process and the bike itself.</p>

<p>I call the bike make 1 because through the tour experience I came up with list of upgrades that are going to make the bike better for the intended purpose, hence make 2. First, it was not a brilliant idea to take an untested bike in a long tour. Of course, everything that can go wrong went wrong. Also, some mechanical parts require a break-in period. I knew this from before but still went on the new bike &ndash; who can resist new and shiny?</p>

<h2>Failures</h2>

<p>The first major issue were the tires. Originally, I was planning to use tubeless cyclo-cross off-road knobby tires. Knowing that most of the roads on the tour are paved I scrambled to get Hutchinson Sector 28 tubeless road tires. However, the new tires could not resist the off-road sections along the river on the way to Chur on the day 2 for too long. I had a side puncture. As a quick solution I&rsquo;ve put in a tube and made a mental note to purchase suitable tires in the next bike shop along the way. I&rsquo;ve made a big mistake when putting the tire on. The tire did not sit evenly so the bike convulsed uncomfortably on every revolution of the wheel. I realized where the mistake was only after I finished the whole tour. Luckily, I&rsquo;ve purchased good 35c tires that day and put them on.</p>

<p>The off-road sections had put a lot of strain on other parts too. Later at night as I was cleaning the bike and replacing the tires I noticed that the rear rack had torn out the whole thread from the frame (the middle hole where canti-levers are mounted on canti-lever frames). The rack could not fall off completely but it could move along the axis for a few centimeters. Clearly, the frame hole was not intended for a loaded rack. I almost thought of taking train back home to take another bike. Instead, I went for the proven zip-tie solution. I used 3 zip ties to secure the failed point to the frame. Part of the solution was to send half of the panniers weight back home by post. I wanted to complete the tour completely and the zip-tie work-around, while not ideal, should have lasted until the finish line.</p>

<p>On a descent following the catastrophic off-road I felt the convulsions of the bike. I did not know at the time that the convulsions were caused by a misaligned rear tire. I stopped for a break to check the bike. Bolts holding the rear rack were all loosened and the rack was viciously swinging from left to right. I also did not notice the frame rack mount failure because the bike was wholly covered with mud.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I discovered that the rear quick release axle was loose! Talk about catastrophic failures on descents! I believe the issue had been caused by the upstand accessory. I would not recommend anyone to use it. I think the problem is fundamental and cannot be worked-around. The bike under its own weight will push on the stand and slowly unscrew the axle. Obviously, it will happen sooner on a loaded bike. But I would never use upstand again even on a lightweight bike.</p>

<p>Less dramatic issues included normal component wear. For example, shifting and braking cables stretch and the drivetrain must be adjusted as a result. This wear becomes noticeable after a 1000km. Gearing on the bike generally worked well and allowed me to climb all hills without an issue. However, I feel that the 50t chainring could be smaller. I had no use for the smallest rear sprockets.</p>

<p>I felt my saddle a bit too well and my hands told me that the handlebar could be just a tad higher. Every incorrect ergonomic setup will make itself known when you ride 140-200km per day. Muscles were nowhere close to limits as my ass and hands were. No wonder experienced tourers will tell you that saddle time is the prevalent factor rather than fatigue or leg muscles.</p>

<h2>Improvements, aka Cube Cross Disc Touring Custom Mk2</h2>

<p>As I discovered the failures and inefficiencies I came up with a list of improvements for make 2 that I am going to present in a separate post. I replaced 30% of the bike and the only part remaining from the original bike is the frameset.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t resist the feeling that building a bicycle from scratch is wasteful. Yes, I have learned lots of things along the way but I also ended up with lots of bike parts that I don&rsquo;t need. I can understand why custom bikes become expensive. The part prices are not necessarily very high but you choose better components than the manufacturer would. And sometimes it&rsquo;s impossible to know if a given part will fit in the unique combination without trial and error.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I always had passion for motorbikes, especially so because everyone around me tried to prevent me from riding as I was growing up. I have started riding motorcycles just 3 years ago not knowing what to expect. I was not sure about whether I want to ride sport bikes or off-road monsters or touring rigs or choppers. Last year I went to a 2 day training camp at <a href="http://www.superbikeschool.com/curriculum/two-day-camps.php">California Superbike School</a> to their Las Vegas Motor Speedway offering. I&rsquo;ve learned skills to handle a powerful BMW S1000RR superbike around the track. Without question, those two days will forever remain a highlight of my life. The training was intensive, well organized and valuable. But I realized that track racing is out of reach for me. Not only there are no racing circuits around where I live it&rsquo;s a also demanding financial burden &ndash; tires, circuit fees, a car to haul the bike, repairs, upgrades, etc. Racing on public roads seems inexcusably dangerous so racing bikes seem a bit pointless. I even sold my bike and thought of calling motorcyling a day. And of course a couple of months later I got the riding itch. After due introspection I understood that touring is what I long for. I love seeing new places, especially if these places are not staples of modern disposable tourism.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s me on the track:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/8724381030/in/set-72157633457951920"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7452/8724381030_9d728231bd.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/8724376318/in/set-72157633457951920"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7411/8724376318_40d47aec73_b.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>Later in 2013 with the adventure ideas in my mind I pulled a plug and ordered a BMW F800 GS Adventure motorcycle for delivery this spring. I decided to change the usual habit of visiting southern countries during vacation and re-visit Sweden and Norway since the old days of living there as a student. Furthermore, I booked a whole month off and did as little planning as possible so as not feel restricted by a prescribed agenda. Before getting into riding I signed-up for a course in off-road riding. One well-known training center is located in Germany near a small town called Hechlingen that 150km away from both, Stuttgart and Munich. It&rsquo;s within 4 hours of driving from where I live.</p>

<p>I got a bike like this:</p>

<p><a href="/images/f800gs.jpg"><img src="/images/f800gs.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.enduropark-hechlingen.de/en/home/">Enduro Park Hechlingen</a> is an official partner of BMW. Their <a href="https://www.enduropark-hechlingen.de/en/home/">web-site</a> is comprehensible and easy to use. I highly recommend to book early in advance. I mean 3 or more months early. I was originally planning to attend a two-day training course with a friend of mine but because collectively we postponed it for too long no two-day slots remained available before the tour. Even as we scrambled to sign-up at least for a one-day training my friend did not secure a spot. Ideally, I&rsquo;d book for a weekend but the only remaining option was a Friday.</p>

<p>Enduro Park Hechlingen offers rental bikes but you can also bring your own. From what I have seen during my training I would not recommend anyone to bring their own bike! You&rsquo;ll likely brake a thing or two and the insurance does not cover track days and training courses. Even though I own a bike I opted for renting the exact same model. I&rsquo;ve dropped the bike a couple of times. During the day I&rsquo;ve also seen scratched wind shields, torn blinkers and carnage, just like in the movies: as a biker on his personal Yamaha Tenere pulled in for a stop for a break his bike got of neutral, jerked forward, fell and started spinning. That caused another bike, a BMW 1200 GS to fall causing a domino-like chain reaction with the nearby bikes. I would not want to pay for such damages!</p>

<p>Protective clothing, however, is not offered for rent. You must have your own helmet, jacket, trousers and gloves. Enduro boots are an exception. The park offers them at 15 Euro per day. I rented as enduro boots cost dearly and I was not sure whether I&rsquo;ll do enough off-road riding in the near future to justify the cost. The boot rental is paid on the spot and must be done in cash.</p>

<p>I rented a car for 2 days to get there and stayed in a hotel the night before to feel fresh and rested. I stayed at a nearby town in one of the recommended hotels. Originally, I had booked a different guest house but due to miscommunication the guest house was closed at the late hour that I arrived.</p>

<p>Finding the center in the morning was not difficult and most people own GPS navigators anyway. I arrived 5 minutes before 9 and most participants were already registered and were waiting in full gear for the briefing to begin. The main building is modern, consisting of a lot of glass panels. There are showers and changing rooms with spacious lockers. I recommend to bring a towel because after a day of intense riding your body will long for a refreshing shower.</p>

<p>Once everyone signed-in and took seats around the table instructors introduced themselves. Then, trainees were assigned into 3 groups based on their skills. I got into the beginners group. That was great for two reasons. One, our group was the smallest (about 6) so we got more attention from the instructor. Two, I never rode a bike off-road before. Everyone but me spoke German but all instructors were prepared to converse in English. My German was good enough to understand everything so I have rarely asked for clarification in English. The beginner&rsquo;s group had a female instructor. Despite her petite size she easily maneuvered a BMW 1200 GS! We went to pick our bikes from the stall. Each bike had a label with trainee&rsquo;s name so it was easy to locate the bike. The bikes are in great shape. Some parts, like mirrors, are understandably removed to prevent damage. We started the bikes and followed our instructor.</p>

<p>As the day progressed we learned various off-road skills and did various excercise. There are a couple of small but important things to keep in mind. Those were repeated many many times over the day. For example, to always keep two fingers over the clutch to stall the engine in case something goes wrong. The training sessions were intermixed with rides across the off-road terrain around the park. Those were really fun! At some point we went on single-track and my first reaction was that it&rsquo;s not possible to go on a single-track with a 150+ kg motorcycle. But since I had to follow there was no time to get desperate. The training was physically demanding. I am fit and I felt exhausted by the end of it. For this reason I don&rsquo;t recommend going for a 2 day course unless you&rsquo;ve done a 1 day training before or have sufficient off-road riding experience under your belt.</p>

<p>At lunch we went to a restaurant in a nearby town. The food was already paid for but the drinks were paid for separately. Credit cards were not accepted. After having food we went for fuel and made a stop at a local ATM because I did not bring cash and could not pay for the boots rental.</p>

<p>By the end of the day at around 5pm we returned the bikes to the stall and gathered around the table to cheer for our victory and receive certificates that we successfully finished the training!</p>

<p>I am confident to ride my bike off-road and I am ready for the upcoming tour! Here we go!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This year I realized that I am wasteful with photo gear so I decided to switch to one digital camera system. I&rsquo;ve sold all cameras and various gear I had from before and settled on Sony A7R. One thing I appreciated from my Canon collection is Yongnuo set of flashes and remote radio triggers. Yongnuo are inexpensive and for a price of one Canon flash I got two flashes and radio controllers. However, despite the fact the flash mounts are the same on Sony A7R and Canon 70D the Yongnuo RF603 radio trigger did not work.</p>

<p>Turns out the solution is one resistor away! I&rsquo;ve discovered the following YouTube video that explains how to make the trigger work with Sony cameras. The solution is to solder a 120kOhm transistor between yellow wire and battery contact plate.</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Iiy4zGEt5xU "></iframe></div>


<p>For years I have avoided any DIY job that requires soldering. I decided now it&rsquo;s finally the time to purchase a solder iron and finally understand basics of electronics.</p>

<p><a href="/images/solder/solder_station.jpg"><img src="/images/solder/solder_station_s.jpg" width="400"></a> <a href="/images/solder/yongnuo_solder.jpg"><img src="/images/solder/yongnuo_solder_s.jpg" width="400"></a></p>

<p>Aaaand success! The trigger now works great on Sony. I know this job was extremely simple but for me it has been satisfying to make a physical electronic thing work differently.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the part 2 of cyclocross bicycle build series. <a href="/blog/2014/04/03/cyclo-cross-bicycle-build-part-1/">Jump to part 1</a>.</p>

<h2>Disassembly preparation</h2>

<p>With the bicycle, materials, tools and parts figured out I was ready to begin the disassembly process. Taking things apart is fun and bicycles are not exception to this rule. As a guide
I reversed the <a href="http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/new-bike-assembly">bike assembly order from Parking Tool website</a>. The process starts with the chain removal and continue along the drive train until the levers and controls are taken off.</p>

<p>With the tools and parts laid before me I went into the process with ecstasy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/13817164744/in/set-72157643416319013"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7409/13817164744_0587cab273.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>At first I hoped to borrow a bike stand from a friend or a colleague. Nobody replied so I purchased my own. It is a lot more convenient to work on bicycles on a proper bike stand. I used to rely on a kickstand or improvisation. With a task such as a whole bicycle assembly ad-hoc solutions become unwieldy and frustrating. I purchased Park Tool PRS-1 stand.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/13816855625/in/set-72157643416319013"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3755/13816855625_3af3d95b3a.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>Cube Cross Disc bicycle looks good on its own. I really like the color scheme. I have purchased a couple of &ldquo;pimping&rdquo; parts to improve aesthetics even further. Things like blue bolts and cable housing, blue jockey wheels and quick release axles.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/13817174464/in/set-72157643416319013"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3667/13817174464_b859ee38eb_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<h2>Getting down to it</h2>

<p>There is nothing inherently difficult in taking a bicycle apart when the right tools are at hand. It&rsquo;s actually a precise and highly satisfying work.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/13817191184/in/set-72157643416319013"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3826/13817191184_85d1bbb951_c.jpg" width="800"></a>
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/13817196104/in/set-72157643416319013"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7102/13817196104_3f29842c79_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>Part by part the bicycle was slowly dissolving until only a frame and wheels remained. A bicycle is a really good illusion. Initially, it appears complex, intricate and intimidating with all the seemingly difficult adjustments. However, once a bicycle is stripped of parts comes a realization of its simplicity and elegance.</p>

<p>The disassembly went on and on until the bicycle looked like this. Note that for the following shot I&rsquo;ve already put different wheels on. I&rsquo;ve left the old cables inside to guide the insertion of new ones.</p>

<p>Shimano 105 component groupset used to power this bike. Now it&rsquo;s going to be replaced with Shimano Ultegra 6800. I will have a bunch of parts that I need to sell. I don&rsquo;t fancy cluttering my place with too many random spare parts and pieces. Hopefully, there are enough bike enthusiasts at work to claim most of them.</p>

<h2>Wheels</h2>

<p>I have never had tubeless road bicycle tires. The assembly process was a bit unusual. Putting road tires on the Stan&rsquo;s Alpha 340 wheelset was relatively painless. But I had typical problems putting cyclocross Raven tires on Alpha 400 even though I had installed the recommended additional rim strip. The problem was the tires did not seal and air went out. Tires would not inflate sufficiently to seal the gaps and air would get out. The solution was to unscrew the valve and let it move inside of the tire for initial setup. Then, I had to pump really hard to reach a critical pressure point. At the same time I was throwing the wheel up slightly so that the tire would fall into place. Still at the same time I screwed the valve back in. This maddening sequence went on until I&rsquo;ve noticed that the air is not escaping as fast as it did initially. An air compressor would come in handy because it would be much easier to reach critical inflation point. Some folks report success with CO2 cartridges.</p>

<p>My complete order from notubes.com contained the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alpha 340 cyclocross wheelset, Shimano 11 speed</li>
<li>Alpha 400 cyclocross wheelset, Shimano 11 speed</li>
<li>Stan&rsquo;s quart of tire sealant</li>
<li>Stan&rsquo;s sealant injector</li>
<li>2x Hutchison 3 tubeless tire</li>
<li>2x Raven tubeless tire</li>
<li>Core remover (to inject sealant into tire without removing it)</li>
</ul>


<p>Stans Alpha 400 wheelset with Raven cyclocross tires (700x35). I&rsquo;ll use this wheelset mostly for winter commuting. I also want to try riding off road courses on this bike.</p>

<p>Stans Alpha 340 wheelset with Hutchison 3 road tires (700x23). Beautiful.</p>

<p>Did I mention that Stan&rsquo;s 3.30 hubs freewheel sound gorgeous?</p>

<h2>Newly discovered alternatives</h2>

<p>I discovered that it is possible to buy decent bicycle frames directly from Chinese manufacturers. Initially, I was skeptical but as I read people&rsquo;s reports it appears that the quality is acceptable. A carbon cyclocross frame costs 500-600$ &ndash; much lower than about 2000$ most manufacturers would ask for. It&rsquo;s also possible to slap a custom paint job on it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After I had initially <a href="/blog/2014/02/07/coffee-is-not-my-friend/">experimented with drinking enormous amounts of coffee per day</a> I abandoned coffee completely. The side effects were too bothersome. I slept too long, crashed too hard during the day and felt pronounced headaches unless I&rsquo;ve drank a cup a day. Two extremes got me thinking &ndash; could I perhaps find an optimal middle ground?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/13697133974/"><img class="left" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7380/13697133974_4624909376_n.jpg" width="320" height="213" title="'My favorite cup'" ></a></p>

<p>With that in mind I&rsquo;ve attempted a moderate approach. I have consumed at most 2 cups (or equivalent amount of caffeine-containing substances) a day. One cup almost immediately upon waking up and another one after lunch or in the afternoon. The morning coffee ritual became essential as I made a push away from evenings into early mornings. I have realized that with a full time job doing anything extra curricular in the evenings is difficult as there is little energy left. Now, I mostly use evenings for being with my wife, reading and relaxing. Of course, there are occasional activities so exciting that even low energy can&rsquo;t stop me. Mornings is a completely different story. When fully rested I feel energized to work on difficult yet fun stuff. For example, every morning for the past 2 months (with rare exceptions) I&rsquo;ve been studying German. I cannot imagine to study a foreign language in the evening. I feel tired, unmotivated and learning feels like a drag. In the long term I hope to gradually break into a habit of waking up at something like 5am while going to bed at 9pm or so. I&rsquo;ll leave the evenings for wine and cigars.</p>

<p>Do I notice any side effects? Not really. I don&rsquo;t feel too bad on days that I miss coffee. I don&rsquo;t get insomnia after drinking an espresso shot at 7pm. I don&rsquo;t feel particularly cranky. I don&rsquo;t crash at 3-5pm.</p>

<p>Moderate amount of caffeine gives a subtle but noticeable mental boost. I am pleased with the results. I will likely continue the practice indefinitely. Perhaps I am stating the obvious with this experiment. Most people consume 1-2 cups a day anyway. In everyday life I take a lot of things for granted. But sometimes, I like to take out a piece of my life-style and change it to see if the change makes a difference. More often than not I arrive at trite conclusions and revert to the old ways. In rare cases I change my habits significantly. But in either case I come out with a better understanding of myself.</p>

<p>I should insert a disclaimer that I don&rsquo;t pay much for coffee. It is free at work and at home I use an inexpensive capsule-based coffee maker. Occasionally (i.e. once every two months or so) I go for an extravagant drink at a coffee shop. If I had to pay for every coffee it costs in coffee shops I would abandon the practice very quickly. Sorry, but very few people realize just how expensive their coffee habit really is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Prologue</h2>

<p>There is a trend I noticed myself going through. First, I tend to acquire lots of equipment and accessories for a hobby or an activity. Then I realize what my true needs are. At some point I get overwhelmed with the gear I don&rsquo;t use regularly and feel wasteful. Finally, I minimize possessions by trading them to fewer precious alternatives. I went through this process with <a href="/blog/2013/10/21/5-sold-gadgets-later-or-welcome-back-to-microsoft-windows/">PCs</a> and <a href="/blog/2013/08/28/impressions-from-freenas/">servers</a>, laptops, digital cameras, motorcycles and now I&rsquo;m going through the same with bicycles. I know it&rsquo;s extravagant and uneconomical. The upside is that I end up with a few possessions that I use extensively and which are satisfying to utilize. Also, once settled on fewer things I lose desire to upgrade or change them.</p>

<p>Until recently I used to own a 2011 Specialized Tarmac carbon road bike. However, I have ridden it only twice last year. I did most of my riding on a full suspension mountain bike and on a <a href="/blog/2014/01/02/6-months-on-a-bike/">hybrid bike</a> that I also commute on. I don&rsquo;t like things lying around without use. So I made a decision to sell two of my bicycles and replace them with a single bike that performs satisfactory under most of my use cases.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68217075@N08/11675646804"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7341/11675646804_4d2d831b20.jpg" width="350"></a></p>

<p>Having gone through experience of upgrading many of the bike components on my bikes I realized that I actually want to have a go at my own build. I am not a mechanics wizard but I&rsquo;ve done many maintenance tasks that are considered difficult, like replacing entire drive-trains, adjusting gear systems and bleeding hydraulic disc brakes. It is generally more expensive to assemble a bike from parts than buying a complete brand new bicycle. With a good deal on a used bike/frame the total price could be manageable but I am jumping ahead of myself.</p>

<h2>The right bike type</h2>

<p>Before venturing into buying or building a bike I think it&rsquo;s useful to think about the use cases. How and where am I going to ride the bike? Am I going to do competitive racing? Am I going to commute on it? Am I going to stay on roads or do occasional gravel? Am I going to ride centuries? Am I going to tour on it? There is no such thing as a perfect bike for everything and there are compromises to be had.</p>

<p>I settled on a hybrid bike the first time I bought a bike. Since then I&rsquo;ve been riding a road bike and a full suspension mountain bike. In retrospective, a hybrid was a poor choice. I do most of riding on paved roads and a road bike is more efficient. Recently I got intrigued by cyclo-cross bicycles. Cyclo-cross bikes are road bikes converted for off-road riding. Cyclo-cross bikes have drop bars and their frame geometries look similar. However, the tires are threaded and often knobbed. Wheels are tougher. Brakes are better and designed for mud and dirt. The frames accommodate larger tires and are designed for maneuverability and often are less aggressive than regular road bikes.</p>

<p>Cyclo-cross seems like a great all-round choice. With tougher wheels and tires cyclo-cross could work well as a commuter. Some frames are outfitted with eyelets so installing a pannier rack is a breeze. In-line brake levers are found more often on cyclo-cross than on road bikes. These levers look like regular flat bar levers and are installed in addition to the default drop bar integrated levers.</p>

<p><a href="/images/cube/inline.jpg"><img src="/images/cube/inline.jpg" width="400"></a></p>

<p>With a second lightweight wheelset and narrow tires a cyclo-cross turns into a proper road cycle. Of course, a dedicated well engineered road bike is better fit for the job but unless it&rsquo;s about racing competitively the cyclo-cross disadvantages will not make a noticeable difference. An extra weight in a backpack of recreational riders defeats many efficiency gains allowed by lighter and more efficient rides.</p>

<p>Personally, I want to commute by this bike to work 15km every day all year round (even in snow and rain) with ortlieb panniers mounted in the back. Occasionally, I want to keep up with my road-biking friends on weekend rides. I am not a weight weenie (biking term) but I don&rsquo;t fancy heavy steel bikes either. Sometimes, I like to take an odd gravel road. And I want to do lightweight touring. Specifically, I am going on a 1200km ride across Europe in May. Does cyclo-cross fit the bill? I bet it does!</p>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>Bike sizing is important. A bike that does not fit a rider well will cause discomfort and pain. Ultimately, nobody will ride a bike that&rsquo;s uncomfortable regardless of how great it is. Hence, it is a good idea to understand how bikes and frames are sized. I admit my knowledge of fitting had been spotty and my beliefs were wrong. The only bike in my stall that fits me like a glove is my mountain bike. And that&rsquo;s by pure chance! The hybrid is a size too small and the road bike had not been setup properly causing too much strain on the lower back. I&rsquo;ve been riding the hybrid for 3 years now. It&rsquo;s unbelievable how much more comfortable riding has become after I&rsquo;ve reconfigured it recently. Now, there are a lot of conflicting sizing techniques and practices. Some say that one must undergo professional computer laser controlled measuring. I think it&rsquo;s bullshit. The only importance is comfort. As long as you can ride comfortably according to your needs you&rsquo;re fine. It does not matter if you were measured with a laser or with a mirror or by a patient friend. Comfort needs could be different. A trained cyclist can stay lower (to be more efficient and aero dynamic) with higher thresholds for discomfort. A recreational cyclist will prefer a more upright position and a smaller difference between seat and handlebar heights.</p>

<p>Bike frames are generally sized according to cyclist&rsquo;s height assuming typical body proportions. In reality, people vary greatly. I am not going to repeat what others have written on the subject. I found a couple great sizing guides that also explain the different frame measurements. The <a href="http://bikedynamics.co.uk/bikesizingbd.htm">guide at BikeDynamics</a> is my favorite. My height is 6&#8217;2 and my body has typical proportions. According to the sizing charts I should be looking at frames sized 58-60cm. There is a chance that a bike won&rsquo;t be comfortable even if the numbers appear perfect. That&rsquo;s why I consider comfort and not the measuring precision of the utmost importance. With the correct frame size decided many finer adjustments could be made. The four popular adjustments I know are: saddle height, fore-aft position, handlebar height and stem length/angle. Again, I am no authority to give much advice so search YouTube for practical instructions. The one <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAl_5e7bIHk">from Performance Bicycle</a> is my favorite.</p>

<p>How much experience is needed to put a bike together from scratch? I am not the one to judge because I have not assembled any yet. However, I fiddled with bicycles for as long as I remember. In the past couple of years I replaced entire drive trains, tuned gearing and blead hydraulic disc brakes. I did not find anything difficult in the process. There are lots of detailed instructions available on YouTube for almost any component. In addition, all bike component manufacturers provide service manuals for their components. I was able to replace a broken hydraulic brake lever for SRAM X0 system. Sure, I needed a couple of specialized tools from eBay and a bit of patience but that&rsquo;s about it! If I went to a bike shop I believe they would replace the whole component. For me, it&rsquo;s not about the money (though a complete SRAM X0 handlebar brake is certainly not cheap). I find that fixing things is fun. To fill in gaps in my bike maintenance knowledge a picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.parktool.com/product/big-blue-book-of-bicycle-repair-3rd-edition-BBB-3">Big Blue Book of Bicycle Repair</a>. The book is great and offers lots of advice that is neatly presented. I discovered subtleties that I was never aware of. Such knowledge makes for a proud and confident owner of a cycle because one knows how all the parts were put together!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/13627957304/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3814/13627957304_77572a176d_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" title="'So what is this chain whip for?'" ></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/13627964604/"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2940/13627964604_31bc8ae254_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" title="'Aaah, this blue book has all the answers!'" ></a></p>

<p>Working with bicycles requires tools. I&rsquo;ve been slowly acquiring them one by one whenever I had to do maintenance tasks. I don&rsquo;t like the idea of buying a kit because a kit usually contains several tools that are never used and a kit misses a few important ones. For example, a chain rivet tool (that disconnects/reconnects chain links) must be compatible with the chain. Older tools won&rsquo;t work with newer 11 speed chains. The bottom bracket tool depends on the kind of bottom bracket a bike has. I think it&rsquo;s better to know exactly what tools are needed by studying the components of the bike. A good complete tool set costs dearly. But if fiddling with bikes is a joy for you I think it&rsquo;s a healthy expense. Borrowing tools sounds great in theory but I personally would not borrow out my tools unless I have high regard for the person&rsquo;s practice. I revised the tools I already own and added the following ones to my collection:</p>

<ul>
<li>Park tool bike stand (building a bike without one sounds like hell to me)</li>
<li>set of allen keys</li>
<li>chain wear indicator</li>
<li>chain cleaner</li>
<li>chain whip</li>
<li>shimano cassette lockring tool</li>
<li>socket and bit set for a torque wrench (I already own two torque wrenches)</li>
<li>greaser, lubricants, degreaser and assembly paste</li>
</ul>


<p>With the preparation behind me comes the excitement of ordering the shiny new parts.</p>

<h2>I chose&hellip;</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned that building a bicycle from scratch is certainly not cheap. Next comes buying brand new followed by used and last-season bikes. The smartest thing is to buy used. In Switzerland, things on the secondary market are usually of great quality and had been cared for meticulously. The prices are at 30-50% of the original retail price. Sometimes, though, there is just no bike that really fits the bill. I found myself in a such situation. I knew I wanted a cyclo-cross so I went through dozens of bike manufacturers&#8217; websites to find the best match. I saw bikes which were expensive (e.g. 5k$ for certain Specialized Crux models) and bikes that did not have equipment or the gearing I wanted. Also, I did not fancy the idea of buying brand new knowing how fast these things depreciate. At some point I entertained the idea of starting a new build from scratch. So I went through another round of websites but this time looked at frames. Unfortunately, I could not find a reasonably priced frame (carbon or aluminium) with the features I needed (disc brakes, eyelets for panniers) and pleasing to the eye. The frame I liked the most is <a href="http://www.specialized.com/us/en/bikes/road/crux/crux-pro-frameset">Specialized Crux Pro Disc</a>. But after factoring in the price (even with a 15% discount) I decided to look for something else. <a href="http://www.specialized.com/us/en/bikes/road/crux/crux-e5-disc-frameset">Specialized Crux E5 Disc</a> would almost be it but it&rsquo;s not sold in Europe and I don&rsquo;t like the color.</p>

<p><a href="/images/cube/crux_pro_disc_frame.jpg"><img src="/images/cube/crux_pro_disc_frame.jpg" width="300"></a> <a href="/images/cube/crux_e5_disc_frame.jpg"><img src="/images/cube/crux_e5_disc_frame.jpg" width="300"></a></p>

<p>As I was getting desperate to find a bicycle I looked at a local bike advertisement board velomarkt.ch. It is a great place for finding cycles. That&rsquo;s where I had found my mountain bike. After spreading the word a couple of my friends found their bikes there too. Miraculously, there was a used cyclo-cross bike for sale in the size I needed (59cm) not very far from where I live. The bike was an aluminum Cube Cross Disc cycle from last year. I have contacted the seller and after a short exchange and some bargaining I hopped on a train and went to Luzern to pick it up.</p>

<p><a href="/images/cube/cube0.jpg"><img src="/images/cube/cube0.jpg" width="400"></a></p>

<p><a href="/images/cube/cube1.jpg"><img src="/images/cube/cube1.jpg" width="400"></a></p>

<p><a href="/images/cube/cube2.jpg"><img src="/images/cube/cube2.jpg" width="400"></a></p>

<p><a href="/images/cube/cube3.jpg"><img src="/images/cube/cube3.jpg" width="400"></a></p>

<p>The bike was in great condition! Seller said he has put about 800km on it. The bike was fresh out of service and the recalled disc brake calipers (Shimano CX-75) had been already swapped with the improved CX-77 version.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve reviewed the specs of the bike thoroughly and went through many articles and photos. It&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.tour-magazin.de/technik/test_center/raeder/rennraeder/cube-cross-race-disc/a29109.html">not praised highly by reviewers</a> and it does not come with fancy components. However, I was not looking for paper figures &ndash; I was searching for something specific, something that would work well for me. And it appears this bike is very close to what I need! The bike has relaxed geometry &ndash; perfect for recreational riding. It even has eyelets for rack installation. I think the bike looks pleasing &ndash; black and white paint job with accentuated blue elements. I knowingly purchased this bike for its frame. I intend to replace most of its components.</p>

<p>Component-wise I have settled on 11 speed Ultegra 6800 groupset with 50/34 crankset and a 10-32 cassette. The combination is flexible enough to give me enough leverage to climb the hilly Swiss terrain and pace reasonably on pavements. I ordered a new handlebar with an ergonomic grip that is correct according to my shoulder width. In addition, I went slightly crazy and ordered a bunch of custom bits and pieces to customize the look, like blue cable housings, bolts and quick release axles. At no point did I consider going Ultegra Di2. I honestly see no purpose in making my bicycle so complicated. Ironically, when I was ten I was imagining that in future derailleurs would have motors in them. The future is apparently already here!</p>

<p><a href="/images/cube/ultegra6800.jpg"><img src="/images/cube/ultegra6800.jpg" width="400"></a></p>

<p>Since I intend to ride the bike both on the road and off the road I decided to get two wheelsets. After a recommendation from a colleague I discovered Stan&rsquo;s tubeless wheels and bought Alpha 400 Disc as a cyclo-cross wheelset and Alpha 340 as a road wheelset. These wheels are lightweight around 1500 grams and accept 11 gear cassettes. Alpha 340 is lighter but has fewer spokes and supports less weight. The prices are reasonable at about 600$ for a set. I ordered matching tires (700x23 Hutchinson Fusion 3 and 700x35 Raven) and accessories for the tubeless wheels, like the sealant and the injector. I have never had tubeless road tires before.</p>

<p><a href="/images/cube/alpha340.jpg"><img src="/images/cube/alpha340.jpg" width="250"></a> <a href="/images/cube/alpha400.jpg"><img src="/images/cube/alpha400.jpg" width="250"></a></p>

<p>I had started ordering parts and tools last Monday and it looks like by next Wednesday I&rsquo;ll have everything in! In total, about 2 weeks of choosing, ordering and waiting for the shipments to arrive.</p>

<h2>Ready-made alternatives</h2>

<p>Of course, once I&rsquo;ve bought the Cube Cross Disc and ordered all the bike parts I discovered that there is a bike that suits my needs almost too well! It&rsquo;s from UK and it&rsquo;s called <a href="http://www.rosebikes.co.uk/products/bikes/race/cross-bike/pro-dx-cross/">Rose Pro DX Cross</a>. The specifications are great and the website allows lots of customization. Best of all, the price is very reasonable. I would have went either with the SRAM Force or Ultegra configuration. Regardless, I don&rsquo;t regret anything and I think I&rsquo;ve made a reasonable decision given the information I had at the time. I&rsquo;ve since seen a couple of these bikes at our office and I am not impressed with their looks. Frankly, their owners outfitted them with ugly looking fenders. I&rsquo;m sure I would have a different opinion if I actually owned one of these.</p>

<p><a href="/images/cube/rose_dx_cross.jpg"><img src="/images/cube/rose_dx_cross.jpg" width="550"></a></p>

<p>As I had mentioned previously, going custom is not cheap. Even with a used bike the price of new components adds up to a significant amount. My initial temptation was to go with a SRAM Red groupset. After I&rsquo;ve calculated how much it would cost in total I decided to bail out.</p>

<h2>The journey ahead</h2>

<p>In about 5-6 days I will receive the remaining shipments with the wheels and parts. I am in no rush with this build. I intend to enjoy every bit of the building process. The joy is in the ride, it&rsquo;s not about getting somewhere! Otherwise, we would not be riding bicycles in the first place. When working I&rsquo;ve learned to let go of the goals and ambitions. For if I look forward to goals I lose the bliss of being present. When I think of a job as a means to a target I consider everything as a hindrance. Irritation sets in quickly and anxiety escalates. And when the goal is finally accomplished I feel empty and bored. Do I want to live in two extremes of anxiety and boredom? Hell no.</p>

<p>I look forward to the disassembly and assembly processes. Working with hands and mechanical devices is one of the most satisfying activities I&rsquo;ve learned as a human being. It feels creative and I forget about time. Yet I remember the hours of work as if the work took much longer. It is joyful and meditative. It feels as if I alter time and live longer.</p>

<p>On May 1 me and a couple of friends are going on a bicycle tour from Andermatt, Switzerland to Rotherdam, Netherlands. The route goes along the river Rhine and is about 1200km in length. We plan to finish this route in 10 days. I personally hope to finish this bike before the trip but as I have already made clear I won&rsquo;t rush. In the worst case, I&rsquo;ll go on my trusted hybrid.</p>

<p>This concludes the part 1 of my custom cyclo-cross bicycle build series. I don&rsquo;t know yet what I will write about in part 2 but I suspect it is going to be about the disassembly process of Cube Cross Disc.</p>
