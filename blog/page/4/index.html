  <div class="entry-content"><p>On a hot Sunday I have joined a couple of cycling enthusiasts to cover an imperial century in the vicinity of canton Zurich:</p>

<p><a href="/images/century-ride.png"><img src="/images/century-ride.png" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I have not ridden a road bike for about a year. This was the first serious ride for the bike I had picked up on a sale last year:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/18091049284"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/451/18091049284_e1861dc5f6_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>It is equipped with one of those fancy Di2 drive-trains which I &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; to extend the standard 10-speed casette to a 11-speed one.</p>

<p><em>Total distance</em>: 162.3km</p>

<p><em>Total vertical ascent</em>: 1182m</p>

<p><em>Difficulty</em>: easy</p>

<p><a href="/files/century-ride.gpx">Download GPS (direct)</a></p>

<p>The ride went much smoother and faster than I expected. I forgot just how much difference there is between a mountain bike and a road bike. Keeping a speed of 25-30kmh on flats is so much less effort than my trusted Salsa Fargo.</p>

<p>There is definitely less comfort on this bike. I could ride my Fargo for 300km per day and feel no pain or discomfort. My hands were definitely tired after a day of riding on the road bike. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine going on a tour on a bike like this.</p>

<p>On a Saturday two weeks ago I went on a bike ride from Zug to Ziegelbrucke through Einsideln and Pfaffikon. I was pretty familiar with many parts of the route.</p>

<p>I have experimented with Microsoft&rsquo;s Hyperlapse Pro software that renders video footage into fast-paced but stable fly-throughs. I am thoroughly impressed with the results and I plan to use it in future biking and hiking trips:</p>

<p>I have never biked or walked along the Obersee (the smaller lake linked to Zurich lake on the East side) so I was delighted by the nice unpaved road along the Northern side of the lake as well as pretty views to the local peaks:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On May 13th I established a new personal record for the longest non-stop hike in my life. Not only it involved 52km and 12 hours of walking but also an ascent of 1500m up to Rigi mountain at the very end of the hike.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/307842580">View our GPS track on Strava</a></p>

<p>Me and my friend Ilya have participated in an annual Swiss event called Rigimarsch. It is a night time hike from a town called Bremgarten all the way up to the Rigi mountain. This year the event attracted 2112 participants.</p>

<p>Note how uplifted we were in the beginning:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/18037115871"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7734/18037115871_4bd103eb54.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The registration normally starts at 19:30. It took us about 40 minutes to go through the queue. Despite a lot people the queue was handled efficiently and everyone was friendly. I was surprised to see so many young people as well as older folks and 12 year olds. The biggest surprise was to see them finish!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/17848376818"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5343/17848376818_ea621aca86.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The weather conditions were perfect. The air was warm during the whole night and we felt comfortable in t-shirts. The first 2 hours of the hike were accompanied by a spectacle of lightnings. Luckily for us it never rained.</p>

<p>The event was exceptionally well executed. There were people regulating the traffic on every intersection of the hiking path with public roads. The route was well indicated with small flags and lamps. It was impossible to get lost. Also, the line of hikers never broke so there were always people in front and ahead of us.</p>

<p>In case someone got tired there were 5 stops where you could take a break, have a snack and take a bus back.</p>

<p>From the 25th kilometer onwards we could see the mountain ahead in the distance. The peak slowly crept closer and closer as our elapsed distance accumulated roughly 40 relatively flat kilometeres. At that point I realized that we still have a mountain to climb. It was gruesome. I could only look at my feet and make one step at a time. I couldn&rsquo;t dare to look up and see just how high we need to go.</p>

<p>The views were fantastic but I felt so tired I could barely continue. I recall feeling really sick and close to throwing up. The last 200 metres up to the summit seemed like eternity.</p>

<p>Note how tired we looked at the end:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have previuosly written a <a href="/blog/2015/02/01/beginners-guide-to-802-dot-11ac-setup/">guide to configure a 802.11ac access point using hostapd in gentoo linux</a>. Another enthusiast discovered that my guide does not lead to a working access point. Turns out I missed crucial steps to configure DFS which is required for operating on higher frequencies. In this guide I diagnose the problem and correct the mistakes. I also show how to increase transmission (TX) power of the wireless card.</p>

<h2>Diagnose the issue</h2>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s wrong with the existing configuration. We will look at the daemon output to troubleshoot. Stop the hostapd service and then start it manually in foreground with:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>wlp4s0: AP-DISABLED
</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The output shows us that hostapd was unable to start due to DFS failure (line &ldquo;DFS start_dfs_cac() failed, -1&rdquo;). It means that DFS is not available so we can&rsquo;t choose a channel that requires DFS. We can double check the local regulations using:</p>

</span><span class='line'>        (5250 - 5330 @ 80), (N/A, 20), (0 ms), DFS

</span><span class='line'>        (57000 - 66000 @ 2160), (N/A, 40), (N/A)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The output shows that frequencies above 5250 Mhz require DFS. This means that channels >52 won&rsquo;t work unless DFS is functional. Let&rsquo;s cross check supported radio channels using &ldquo;iw&rdquo;:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&ldquo;no IR&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;no initiate radiation&rdquo;. It essentially means that the card cannot be used as an access point on that frequency. However, when &ldquo;no IR&rdquo; goes in hand with &ldquo;radar detection&rdquo; it means that the card can be used but only with DFS. It&rsquo;s another reminder that DFS is required.</p>

<h2>Fix the issue by disabling DFS</h2>

<p>An obvious solution is to avoid using DFS by choosing a channel that does not require radar detection. In the case of Switzerland channel 44 is a safe choice.</p>

<p>To disable DFS and to choose a channel that does not require DFS do following changes to the configuration file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ap ~ # vi /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>...
</span><span class='line'>channel=44
</span><span class='line'>...
</span><span class='line'>ieee80211h=0
</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Save the changes and restart hostapd. Everything should work now. Enabling DFS is by no means necessary. In fact, I&rsquo;m running my access point on a frequency which does not require DFS. I observe significantly better transfer rates on non-DFS channels.</p>

<p>However, if you&rsquo;re curious and/or would like to get DFS to work read on.</p>

<h2>Enable DFS support in the kernel</h2>

<p>It turns out that DFS must be enabled in kernel and by default the option is hidden from kernel configuration dialogs. To check if DFS is enabled look through kernel message output:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ap ~ # dmesg
</span><span class='line'>...
</span><span class='line'>[    2.850086] ath10k_pci 0000:04:00.0: debug 1 debugfs 1 tracing 0 dfs 0 testmode 0
</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The output indicates that DFS is disabled (&ldquo;dfs 0&rdquo;). To enable DFS you must enable following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Configure standard kernel features (expert users)&rdquo; under &ldquo;General Setup&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;cfg80211 certification onus&rdquo; under &ldquo;Networking support > Wireless&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Atheros DFS support for certified platforms&rdquo; under &ldquo;Device Drivers > Network device support > Wireless LAN > Atheros Wireless Cards&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>Re-compile the kernel and verify if the kernel output indicates DFS support. Then, re-enable DFS and choose a higher channel of your liking.</p>

<p>I have experimented with the higher channels but I discovered throughput was significantly worse. In addition, not all client machines recognize upper 5Ghz channels. For example, EU version of Asus PCE-AC68 card in Windows doesn&rsquo;t function on channels >48. A <a href="http://www.snbforums.com/threads/pce-ac66-wifi-card-not-picking-up-5ghz-149-161-channels.10932/">work-around soltion</a> is to alter the driver&rsquo;s *.ini file and re-install the driver:</p>

<h2>Fix DFS-UNSET problem</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re seeing &ldquo;DFS-UNSET&rdquo; in &ldquo;iw reg get&rdquo; output upgrade crda package to at least version 3.18.</p>

<h2>Increase TX power</h2>

<p>Local regulations dictate maximum radiation power and operating frequencies. Certain radios are hard-coded to geographical regions, e.g. United States. Regulatory compliance software runs the strictest set of rules that intersect the pre-programmed and chosen regions. In other words, a radio that is pre-programmed for US and is operated in Switzerland will disable channels that are prohibited in US but perfectly legal in Switzerland. Same goes for power. Radio will operate on the lowest power allowed in the two regions. To overcome these limitations it is sometimes possible to re-program the radio&rsquo;s EEPROM and set a different region.</p>

<p>A simpler solution is to alter the regulations which are maintained by the wireless software stack and not the radio itself. On Linux the idea is to compile a custom regulatory daemon which allows a modified set of regulations. The regulations themselves are modified by replacing entries corresponding to the hard-coded radio region to whatever is desired by the user:</p>

<ol>
<li>download wireless-regdb package, unpack</li>
<li>modify &ldquo;db.txt&rdquo; file by replacing entries corresponding to the radio&rsquo;s region with desired configuration. In my case I search for Swiss regulations (CH) and copy them over the rules for US and 00 (00 stands for global).</li>
<li>run &ldquo;make&rdquo;</li>
<li>copy generated rule set out: cp regulatory.bin /usr/lib/crda/regulatory.bin</li>
<li>download crda package, unpack</li>
<li>copy *pem files from wireless-regdb folder to crda/pubkeys subfolder</li>
<li>run &ldquo;make&rdquo;, followed by &ldquo;make install&rdquo;</li>
<li>reboot</li>
</ol>


<p>This procedure generates a custom regulatory daemon that trusts the set of regulations we have altered. Obviously, these changes won&rsquo;t persist after a package upgrade so you would need to repeat them should newer packages get released.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not difficult to inadvertently break your local laws by altering regulatory restrictions so be careful with the changes. Try also not to fry yourself with radiation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since I rode with my friend John around Swiss-Italian lakes 2 weeks ago I wanted to return and do a loop that goes into Italian valley Centovalli. We had omitted it from our tour because topographical maps were suggesting that there&rsquo;s 2200m of climbing involved and that was outside of our &ldquo;daily budget&rdquo;. However, so much ascent seemed excessive for an altitude difference of 600m.</p>

<p>Last Saturday me and my friends Riccardo and Codrin came back to bust this myth once and for all. Turns out that a loop that goes into the valley from Locarno involves just 800-900m of climbing! Since that was too easy for us I added a small surprise at the final half of the route bringing total ascent to respectable 1561m.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a short summary of the ride:</p>

<p><a href="/images/centovalli-loop.png"><img src="/images/centovalli-loop.png" width="500"></a></p>

<p><em>Total distance</em>: 105km</p>

<p><em>Total vertical ascent</em>: 1561m</p>

<p><em>Difficulty</em>: medium</p>

<p><a href="/files/centovalli-loop.gpx">Download GPS (direct)</a></p>

<p>We came to Locarno by taking a 07:09 train from Zürich HB.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/17210691076"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8729/17210691076_99981dfc83_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>After a change in Bellinzona we went for coffee and fruity snacks in a local cafe close to the train station. It&rsquo;s called Manora restaurant and it serves delicious and fresh buffet. Both Riccardo and Codrin rode road bikes and were good at it so I had to push a little extra to catch up and skip some of the stops.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/17210695006"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7726/17210695006_dd61ec1279_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/16616448093"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5449/16616448093_0ddd236ae0_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>The climbing grade was steady. The scenery was spectacular and there were very few cars on the roads.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/17236102031"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7713/17236102031_b7ac8d14b9_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>We got to the top of our route in Finero. On our way down we found a nice restaurant and had 2-course meals. I went for tagliatelle with mushrooms and a medium-rare steak. The food was delicious and despite being filling we did not get bloated.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/16616459463"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8759/16616459463_324bdbb985_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>The road along the lake was not busy and the breeze from water felt refreshing. To make things a little more interesting we went on a de-tour that involved an additional 300m climb with a rather steep grade. Since at that point we stopped talking I conclude the climb was met with due respect. The climb rewarded us with views on the lake.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/17236684575"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7638/17236684575_dd69133af0_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>On a descent to Locarno I felt wiggling of the front wheel. On one of the hairpins I almost lost balance of the bike and went slightly into the opposite lane. I had a puncture but the air was escaping steadily. I decided to fix it once we got to Locarno.</p>

<p>In Locarno Riccardo left us and went to see his girlfriend&rsquo;s family who were visiting the region. Me and Codrin continued to Bellinzona in a fast pace to make it to the next train.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t yet ridden this route I suggest you take a train and do it. The views alone are worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to purchase a laptop as I find myself longing for a computer away from my beloved workstation more often. Last time I bought a laptop was 8 years ago.</p>

<p>Dell built a laptop I feel genuinely excited about &ndash; the new XPS 13. It&rsquo;s as small as 11&#8221; machine with really narrow bezel. It comes with specs that are just right for me.</p>

<p><a href="/images/dellxps/dell_order_01.png"><img src="/images/dellxps/dell_order_01.png" width="500"></a></p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;ve learned that buying from Dell is not that easy! I was trying to order XPS 13 laptop with a US layout keyboard using Swiss regional site dell.ch. When I choose US keyboard I get presented with the following error:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The selection &ndash; MUI Etikett für Handauflage is incompatible with Tastatur&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="/images/dellxps/dell_order_02.png"><img src="/images/dellxps/dell_order_02.png" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="/images/dellxps/dell_order_03.png"><img src="/images/dellxps/dell_order_03.png" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="/images/dellxps/dell_order_05.png"><img src="/images/dellxps/dell_order_04.png" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I have no clue what &ldquo;MUI Etikett für Handauflage&rdquo; is. It looks like some kind of internal article name. In English it means &ldquo;MUI sticker for palm rest&rdquo; which still makes little sense. I confirmed that the same issue is present on other European Dell stores. I checked Austrian and German sites. Same problem.</p>

<p>I honestly tried to contact support to get it done. Phone support in Switzerland does not provide help unless you have already bought something from Dell. I&rsquo;ve tried contacting other deparments and a support agent suggested I try chat support in Germany. I described the error and provided a screen-shot. The agent said it&rsquo;s a known problem and that it&rsquo;s going to be fixed. Just to be sure the agent recommended I try again tomorrow.</p>

<p>Well, the problem is still there 1.5 weeks later so I guess it&rsquo;s not going to be fixed anytime soon. Anyway, the point of this article is that it&rsquo;s possible to make an order by modifying JavaScript using Developer Tools (in Chrome) or an equivalent in other browsers. It&rsquo;s as simple as enabling the &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; button. Step by step instructions are provided below:</p>

<p>Find the HTML element in DOM that corresponds to the purchase button and remove the &ldquo;disabled&rdquo; class attribute::</p>

<p><a href="/images/dellxps/dell_order_06.png"><img src="/images/dellxps/dell_order_06.png" width="500"></a></p>

<p>Repeat the procedure on the next screen:</p>

<p><a href="/images/dellxps/dell_order_07.png"><img src="/images/dellxps/dell_order_07.png" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="/images/dellxps/dell_order_08.png"><img src="/images/dellxps/dell_order_08.png" width="500"></a></p>

<p>So far my order has not been cancelled but I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s going to work. If this fails I think I&rsquo;ll hold off buying a laptop at this time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I commute daily all year round my cycling season never stops. Longer rides, however, mostly don&rsquo;t happen in winter. To open 2015 biking season I went with my friend John on a 2-day cycling tour during the Easter holiday. Because the weather forecast was predicting windy and rainy conditions in most of the Switzerland we decided to go south and ride along several lakes in Italy and Ticino.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember when was the last time I planned a trip from scratch. Most of the rides in Switzerland are easy to put together because the bicycle trail network is <a href="http://www.veloland.ch/en/veloland.html">extensively and accurately described</a>. I had naive notions that I&rsquo;ll be done with all planning in an hour. It took me more than seven and I learned a couple of useful lessons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>planning takes considerable effort</p></li>
<li><p>quality information is difficult to come by &ndash; several topographical maps contradict each other; cycling route suggestions are scarce; it&rsquo;s impossible to gauge how scenic/worthwhile the routes are</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Preparations and planning went late into the night. The route went through ten or so iterations. Every time I started from scratch I thought I&rsquo;ll never get it done. When John was already rightfully asleep I realized a major problem &ndash; all trains heading to our destination had their biking spots booked. Luckily, I could find a rental car in a nearby station.</p>

<p>The final route took the following shape (gpx tracks are available from Strava):</p>

<p><a href="/images/italylakemap.png"><img src="/images/italylakemap.png" width="500"></a></p>

<p><em>Total distance</em>: 206.8km</p>

<p><em>Total vertical ascent</em>: 2710m</p>

<p><em>Difficulty</em>: easy+ (100km per day relaxed pace with some climbs)</p>

<h2>Day 1: Bellinzona &ndash; Verbania &ndash; Varese (109.5km, 1317m)</h2>

<p>Woke up at 5:00. Everything was already packed and prepared for departure.</p>

<p>At 5:30 I fetched the car from a nearby mobility station. I packed my bike into the car and headed home to have breakfast.</p>

<p>At 8:00 I met John at the local train station. We packed his bike and bags and headed out to Bellinzona. The radio said there was a usual 10km traffic jam in the Gotthard tunnel so we decided to take a detour through San Bernadino. Retrospectively it was a good decision. In an hour the traffic jam extended to 20km.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/16833485087"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7727/16833485087_b8651754fb_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>At 11:30 we ate a couple of sandwiches and had the bikes ready and the car parked by the Park and Ride at the train station. We made a mistake because the parking ended up costing 80 CHF. The right way to use P+R is to buy a parking card in advance. That&rsquo;s possible through SBB ticket shop.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/16833492857"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7688/16833492857_e9a2db6dfc_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>We rode through Ascona and before we followed the road along the lake Maggiore we took a scenic detour. It involved a short climb but rewarded us with a quiet road and scenic views.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/16420762723"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8783/16420762723_c8b0efb0fc_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>Once the detour ended we joined the road that goes along the lake. A lot has been said about the amount of traffic on this road. It is bad but the view of the lake makes up for it. We also inhaled a yearly dose of car exhaust.</p>

<p>There are lots of voiced opinions about dangers of riding in Italian traffic. I believe this is not an issue if you ride defensively and mindfully. This means you don&rsquo;t feel privileged on the road and you don&rsquo;t always go as fast as you can. Instead, you pay attention to the other actors and anticipate moves and turns. I don&rsquo;t mind waiting on traffic lights and not riding to the next car in front of me because I feel the driver does not see me. I also don&rsquo;t mind breaking if I see that there&rsquo;s a car making a maneuver.</p>

<p>We rode until we got to a city called Verbania. 5km to Verbania I caught a flat tire, probably due to debris on the road.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/16854705579"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7608/16854705579_3bcf41c3e0_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>After a lunch in Verbania we took a ferry Intra-Levano. Don&rsquo;t ask me why the ferry is not called Verbania-Levano.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/16854713929"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7591/16854713929_872af205b6_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>The road from Levano took us through typical Italian villages and relatively quiet roads. We continued along the lake Varese which has a nice cycling path along the perimeter. It reminded me of Bodensee.</p>

<p>At about 21:00 we reached our 4-star hotel in Varese close to the hippodrome. The hotel reminded me of a Las Vegas resort. We arrived just in time to have dinner. The hotel staff was nice and let us keep our bikes in the storage room.</p>

<h2>Day 2: Varese &ndash; Como &ndash; Lugano (97.3km, 1393m)</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/279757682">Download GPS track for day 2</a> <a href="/files/italy_easter_tour_day2.gpx">direct</a></p>

<p>We slept until 10:00 to compensate for the prior sleep deprivation. After having breakfast we left the hotel at about 11:30.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/16833521447"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8701/16833521447_cc695c5e84_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>First part of the route took us through relatively busy roads and several towns. Then we rode through narrow local windy roads.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/17040940285"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7716/17040940285_b89b0bb83f_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/16853408070"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7589/16853408070_a33b3f7899_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/16418508144"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8686/16418508144_722de657af_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>We then arrived in Como and continued along the lake. The road was much wider than the one along Maggiore and there was seemingly less traffic. In addition, there were long stretches of local roads that were almost free of cars.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/17040113251"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7643/17040113251_48516dc99a_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>We had lunch in Mennagio. The road from Mennagio to Lugano involved a steady climb which quickly warmed us up from dropping temperature.</p>

<p>Crossing the Italian-Swiss border is apparently for cars only as the connecting tunnel is designed for motorized traffic. I&rsquo;m not sure how are bicyclists and pedestrians are supposed to cross it. It was not that bad as it&rsquo;s only 2km long.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/16833554197"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8767/16833554197_651934dfb0_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>At 21:00 we arrived in Lugano. We biked the steep path from the city to the train station and hopped on a train to Bellinzona.</p>

<p>In Bellinzona we loaded up our gear and went back through Gotthard tunnel. We arrived at 23:00 in the mobility parking station where we unloaded our gear and headed to Wadenswil train station. John took a train and I cycled back to my place.</p>

<h2>Tips and lessons learned</h2>

<p>To avoid packing too much stuff into panniers I used just one bag. However, that makes the bike slightly unbalanced. Also, a full bag spoils aesthetics of the bike. Two bags is better. To my future self: pack one bag and then spread the load across two bags. Don&rsquo;t start with two bags because that&rsquo;s a recipe for taking too much gear.</p>

<h2>Final words</h2>

<p>Despite few setbacks the tour went amazingly smooth. The ride was varied with different kinds of scenery and roads and we got to taste the region. I&rsquo;m looking forward to more rides this year!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The bookshelves and the Internet are filled with articles and books containing life-changing ideas. Between fiction, non-fiction, psychology, biographies and self-help literature lies a curriculum unfulfillable in thousands of life times. Many of the ideas have the potential to drastically improve one&rsquo;s life. But there is a world of difference between <em>just agreeing</em> and <em>truly internalizing</em> any one of those ideas. And there&rsquo;s even a wider gap between applying an idea in a safe limited environment versus applying it in a high stakes situation. The former is akin to a sandbox, shielding us from failure and limiting our losses in case of failure. The latter is enshrouded in fear and uncertainty because the potential losses are real, significant and palpable. Though only the latter lets us reap deep benefits and become better selves.</p>

<p>Not only is there a difference between knowing an idea and internalizing idea but there&rsquo;s often no real situation in one&rsquo;s life where that idea could be applied at a given moment. Life-changing ideas are somewhat like tools. To use a tool there must be something to apply it to, a subject. If I suddenly receive an advanced spectroscope I won&rsquo;t have a clue what to do with it. After looking up what a spectroscope is on Wikipedia I&rsquo;ll possibly try to use it to measure something, just to feel good about myself and that I am intelligent enough to figure out how to use it. I&rsquo;ll then put the spectroscope in a box never to be seen again. An astronomer, however, would be glad to have the same tool at his disposal. Unlike me, the astronomer has a real use for the spectroscope. My use of the spectroscope is superficial while the astronomer could use it for a real breakthrough.</p>

<p>It occurred to me recently that getting in trouble is very important for a good lived life. Getting in trouble is the first step of personal growth and improvement in any area. Without trouble there&rsquo;s no use for solutions. Tools are usually created to solve a problem, to get out of trouble. It&rsquo;s not often that a tool is created first and then a use is figured out for it. Literature and media creates an opposite impression. Trouble, problems, inefficiency are portrayed in a negative light. Solutions, ideas, new ways of thinking are then glorified. But in this transition an important aspect is forgotten. Without the trouble in the first place nobody would care about a solution. Two thousand years ago humans could not care less about climate change and improvements to our energy production methods. These improvements are important for our well-being but two thousand years ago there was nothing to apply these improvements to. There was simply no such trouble as environment pollution.</p>

<p>Best-selling manage-everything books similarly portray trouble in negative light and gladly present solutions. For instance, time management books present 1001 strategies on dealing with overburden and stress. But few of the works will take a pause to acknowledge the value of being overburdened in the first place. Being overburdened and stressed means that we have taken on lots of responsibilities. While the situation itself may be undesirable our past courage deserves respect and acknowledgment. If we lied around the house all day and did not do anything at all we would not have these problems! It&rsquo;s not the missing acknowledgment that personally bothers me but the resulting reversal of solutions and problems. I don&rsquo;t need time management advice until I take up too many responsibilities and assignments. When I try to apply all the little tips and strategies I don&rsquo;t need I waste my energy I could have used to actually do something. I also get a false feeling that I am a master of time management. But the reality is that I&rsquo;m no better at time management than I&rsquo;m at astronomy with the spectroscope I had previously been gifted.</p>

<p>My personal take away is to get in trouble more often. I have nothing against reading what the best minds have already figured out. In fact, knowing what exists out there helps when the reality finally confronts with insurmountable obstacles. But I am cautious not to foolishly get enthused about the problems I don&rsquo;t currently have.</p>
