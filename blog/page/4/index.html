  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/images/80211ac.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/80211ac.jpg" width="240"></a></p>

<p>About 3 months ago I had nothing better to do so I decided to replace an off-the-shelf Linksys E4200 wireless router with a custom build running an unrestricted O/S. I admit E4200 worked reliably through the years on stock firmware but I never felt comfortable with the privacy and network vulnerability aspects of commonly sold devices. And I find third-party router firmwares too complicated to fully comprehend and tweak. There&rsquo;s simply too much configuration becauase it needs to satisfy many use cases.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never documented that assembly and installation experience so when a new opportunity to build a 802.11ac access point using very similar hardware came about I jumped right at it.</p>

<p>In general, there&rsquo;s nothing particularly novel about buying standard x86 hardware, putting together a couple of components and then installing Linux on it. But with wireless networking, especially 802.11n and 802.11ac, there&rsquo;s numerous configuration options available. Without tuning and verification a 802.11ac/802.11n setup might run as fast as 802.11g which isn&rsquo;t any fast at all. After going through these builds I&rsquo;m hesitant to take wireless configuration for granted, especially when just buying SOHO grade equipment.</p>

<h2>The &ldquo;why&rdquo;</h2>

<p>Why do a DIY router build? There&rsquo;s the privacy and vulnerability aspects that I had already mentioned. Large manufacturers discontinue updating their SOHO devices within years of release. In light of critical vulnerabilities found just in core Linux libraries it is not an assuring situation.</p>

<p>But the real reason that pushed me to change are the unnecessary features and small things that can&rsquo;t be configured on most SOHO routers. For example, there are often built-in DNS servers but most of the devices I&rsquo;ve used don&rsquo;t let the user to set the default search domain. Instead, these routers push the search domain from ISP. It&rsquo;s a minor detail but there are plenty such annoyances.</p>

<p>The unneeded features just scream additional attack vectors to me. I prefer to have a list of iptables rules that fits on a screen because I&rsquo;m not running an ISP or a data-center at home. I can isolate untrusted devices and let them connect to the Internet only without having any access to other hosts in the network.</p>

<h2>Bits and parts</h2>

<p>I have built the router based on <a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/apu.htm">PC Engines APU x86 board</a>. It has a relatively powerful CPU, PCI express bus, mSATA, SIM slot, USB, serial port and other extras. I like the passive cooling and low power consumption. I would not want a router based on old PC desktop hardware because that takes up a lot of space, burns lots of power and makes noise.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/16415575152/"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8612/16415575152_0ba93b669e_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>Total cost of parts for dual-radio 802.11n router came at around 200$. The price for the new 802.11ac access point is higher at around 260$. That&rsquo;s because the 802.11ac radio. In total, the materials don&rsquo;t cost significantly more than off-the-shelf stuff.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/15794024864/"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8671/15794024864_8b2a475c9d_n.jpg" width="240"></a></p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m living in Switzerland and PC Engines is a Swiss company I had one more reason to order from them. I&rsquo;m impressed with the shipping speed and invoice-based payment.</p>

<p>The list of parts for the 802.11ac build:</p>

<ul>
<li>SSD M-Sata 16GB MLC Phison</li>
<li>APU.1D system board 2GB</li>
<li>Enclosure 3 LAN, black</li>
<li>AC adapter 12V 2A</li>
<li>3x Antenna reverse SMA dual band</li>
<li>3x Cable MMCX &ndash;> reverse SMA</li>
<li>SATA data + power cable (for a hack, read further)</li>
<li>Mini PCI Express Extender Extension FFC Cable</li>
<li>COMPEX WLE900V5-23 miniPCIe module, AR9880, 802.11ac, 3*3MIMO</li>
</ul>


<p>Unlike with the 802.11n router build I had to do a couple of simple hacks to put it all together. The Compex 802.11ac radio is wide so it does not fit in a standard miniPCIe slot. I had to order an extension cable from eBay and use double-sided adhesive tape to put the radio on the inside &ldquo;ceiling&rdquo; of the enclosure. Then, I had to drill a hole in the enclosure to put an additional 3rd antenna for achieving 3*3MIMO. Finally, Compex radio requires external 5V supply. Luckily, the board has pins for powering a SATA drive. I&rsquo;ve cut a <a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/satacab1.htm">SATA data+power cable</a> and used the power connector to connect 5V positive to the radio.</p>

<p>You can see the semi-assembled board on the photo:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/16414742291/"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7311/16414742291_6258b980e9_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<h2>Connecting, O/S install</h2>

<p>PC Engines APU board comes without a graphics adapter. I/O happens through serial port. I had to buy a USB adapter (that occasionally BSODs Windows 8) and guess what the correct settings are (parity, speed, etc). Furthermore, the settings could change through the boot process as the running software can change the configuration.</p>

<p>PC Engines provides a utility to create a bootable USB drive for updating the firmware. It works really well and requires no fiddling whatsover. The APU board serial rate is set to 115200 with the rest of values as default.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible to use SD card, USB flash drive, mSATA or SATA for storage. I opted in for mSATA because SSDs are not that expensive anymore (especially the small 16GB kind), much faster than flash and more reliable.</p>

<p>I considered using MikroTik and other AP/router distributions. I could not get MikroTik to respond on serial no matter what settings I tried. I&rsquo;m glad it never worked because MikroTik is unnecessarily complex for my needs. It&rsquo;s an anti-thesis of the simplicity I&rsquo;m striving for.</p>

<p>My Linux distribution of choice is Gentoo. To install Gentoo I used a bootable Linux USB drive. Almost any live USB distribution works as long as it has basic command line tools. I did as little as I could on serial and enabled SSH as soon as possible. To enable serial it&rsquo;s important to add <strong>console=ttyS0,115200n8</strong> to the kernel boot arguments. That also applies for booting live distributions.</p>

<p>Since the router I had worked on is so similarly specced to the new access point build I made a shortcut in the install process. Instead of installing from scratch I copied an image of the existing disk. I&rsquo;ve then logged-in into the access point and changed settings.</p>

<p>The rest of the installation steps are left as an exercise to the reader. Joking aside, the official Gentoo installation documentation is sufficiently sharp to get a running system. I have included important configuration files at the end of the article.</p>

<h2>Software setup, hostapd and 802.11ac specifics</h2>

<p>Once the system boots we get to the interesting part of making the access point part of our access point build working. And there are a couple of important details.</p>

<h3>Channels</h3>

<p>Radio channels were relatively simple to comprehend in the days of 802.11b/g 2.4Ghz spectrum. There are 11 20Mhz channels, of which 3 non-overlapping. The setup consist of choosing the channel which has least interference and least amount of users.</p>

<p>In 5Ghz spectrum things become more complicated. The channels vary in width: from 20 Mhz all the way up to 160 Mhz. There are several frequency ranges and these ranges are regulated. Regulations differ from country to country. It&rsquo;s not possible to choose just any channel. It is necessary to check which channels are allowed, which channels is the radio capable of and then decide based on busyness of the ether.</p>

<p>To check which channels are allowed by the regulations run <strong>iw reg get</strong>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>country CH: DFS-UNSET
</span><span class='line'>        (2402 - 2482 @ 40), (N/A, 20), (N/A)
</span><span class='line'>        (5170 - 5250 @ 80), (N/A, 20), (N/A)
</span><span class='line'>        (5250 - 5330 @ 80), (N/A, 20), (0 ms), DFS
</span><span class='line'>        (5490 - 5710 @ 160), (N/A, 27), (0 ms), DFS
</span><span class='line'>        (57000 - 66000 @ 2160), (N/A, 40), (N/A)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The output shows the regulation for Switzerland (CH) because I have previously set the country using <strong>iw reg set</strong> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ap ~ # iw reg set CH</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By the way, unless you change the domain to the country where you reside the radio will be restricted by the set of all countries. In reality this means that almost all channels will be out of bounds. I set the domain in a startup script.</p>

<p><strong>DFS</strong> is a technology that allows wireless to work on frequencies shared with weather radars and other systems on the same frequency bands. <strong>DFS</strong> makes the radio listen for pulses from those systems to prevent interference.</p>

<p>The channels supported by radio can be listed using <strong>iw list</strong>:</p>

<h3>Radio firmware</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m using Compex WLE900V5-23 radio that is based on Atheros AR9880 2.0 chipset. The support is available in kernel with <strong>ath10k</strong> module. However, the required firmware is not shipped with <strong>linux-firmware</strong> package yet so it&rsquo;s required to manually download the firmware and put it into the kernel source tree.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve obtained the firmware from <a href="https://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware.git">ath10k git repository</a>. I&rsquo;ve then placed the <strong>ath10k</strong> directory in <strong>firmware</strong> directory in the kernel source tree. Finally, I&rsquo;ve changed the following kernel settings to build the firmware into the kernel:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>CONFIG_EXTRA_FIRMWARE_DIR="firmware"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Network setup and hostapd</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve configured the new access point to work as a bridge. It does not do any routing. The access point makes the wired connection available to wireless clients.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using OpenRC. Configuration in <strong>/etc/conf.d/net</strong> is very simple. There is a bridge configuration linked to the wired interface:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p><strong>hostapd</strong> configuration describes capabilities of the radio and sets up the frequencies, security and useful features. For example, to use wireless on <strong>DFS</strong> controlled frequencies it is required to enable <strong>ieee80211d</strong> and <strong>ieee80211h</strong> settings. Here&rsquo;s a working and tested 802.11ac setup that I&rsquo;m using right now:</p>

<h2>Final words and config files</h2>

<p>Once hostapd is running it&rsquo;s important to measure transfer rates. The first time I ran hostapd I was getting 802.11b speed. After a day of experimenting and reading through mailing list discussions I arrived at a configuration that yields 60 MB/s (480Mbit) real world samba transfer speed! I&rsquo;m genuinely impressed as it&rsquo;s more than 2X faster than the existing 802.11n setup that I currently have.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In May 2014 I embarked on a motorcycle journey through many European countries with Norway as the destination. The round-trip tour from Zürich, Switzerland was about 8000 Km long and took about 4 unrushed weeks to complete. It was a first ride of such length for me.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/16169221988/"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7367/16169221988_f3d234f1fd_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>I rode alone and I stayed mostly in hotels with an occasional camping in between. Most of the planning was done by my wife. She planned out every day, chosen the most scenic and twisty mountain roads. At the time I had wrong preconceptions about traveling without an agenda. It&rsquo;s sounds like relaxing and laid-back but the reality crushes the idyll  in a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>

<p>Despite lack of skill and experience very few things went wrong. The only serious issue was a flat front tyre. Sorting out the incident set me back for a day as I furiously searched for an evacuator and an adequate repair shop.</p>

<p>Equipment-wise I carried too many unneeded items and lacked a couple of things that would reduce frustration with the baggage: an additional top case instead of a duffel bag/back-pack and liners for existing side cases to quickly extract and carry belongings. The tank bag is immensely useful but I missed &ldquo;organizer&rdquo; liner that would keep things in place.</p>

<p>There were too many cooking utensils and too few cooking occasions. I feel it makes more sense to eat out in local restaurants and cafes once a day and purchase food that does not need preparation in local grocery stores. Most of Europe is not remote or uninhabited enough to warrant extensive cooking arsenal.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/15736982513/"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7400/15736982513_257bda09ba_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>The most scenic and memorable places were all around Alesund and Trondheim in Norway. On my next visit I&rsquo;m going to spend bulk of the itinerary in the surroundings, going as far as North as possible.</p>

<p>I feel I have not spent enough time &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo;. The Northern areas are beautiful and I wish to trek trails and perhaps climb rocks. I think it would also be more fun to travel with someone else.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/16169271628/"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8596/16169271628_c4ff3d0059_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>Looking at the photos from last year excites me to plan new adventures for 2015.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&hellip;continued from <a href="/blog/2014/12/03/what-i-learned-from-a-10-day-bicycle-tour/">part 1</a>.</p>

<h2>12. Nutrition and hydration</h2>

<p>Regular nutrition is key to riding sustainably for many kilometers. In the morning or the previous evening you should stock up on dried fruit, bananas, bars and other snacks. I can ride for many hours if I eat something small every hour or so.</p>

<p>Big meals are great but they are time consuming. There&rsquo;s also a fat chance of overeating. I recommend planning for dinner and nothing else.</p>

<p>Drinking plenty of water is essential. Without sufficient hydration you will get tired too quickly. I had a camelbak and two extra water bottles. Even in Europe water fountains could be hard to come by.</p>

<h2>13. Team tempo</h2>

<p>People have varying fitness levels so their comfortable cruising speeds differ. Riding at the slowest common speed might not be the best strategy because riding slower than it is comfortable could be straining. And when the route is challenging and not everyone has a GPS it is hard to coordinate catch-ups.</p>

<p>I had terrible pain in my butt so I preferred to race ahead for about an hour and then take a 10 minute brake. It was the time in the saddle which was the hardest for me. As you can imagine, we got lost regularly but miraculously were able to catch up each and every day.</p>

<h2>14. Leave early, arrive early</h2>

<p>Leave early and arrive early. Leave at 8:30 the latest and plan to arrive before 18:00. This means that you should plan to leave at 8. Anytime later is a recipe for spiraling late arrival. There won&rsquo;t be enough time to rest, to take care of the body and the bikes.</p>

<h2>15. Accommodation</h2>

<p>Choose the best accommodation you can. Places that allow to relax and wind down. When I&rsquo;m stressed because a place is smelly, cramped and dirty I won&rsquo;t rest. And I will be tired the following day.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to book separate rooms. Some people prefer to leave the bedroom window open to let fresh air in. Others feel too cold. Some snore. Others find it hard to fall asleep.</p>

<p>Accommodation is a matter of personal choice. Some people prefer to camp or stay in hostels. On this tour I wish we had chosen better hotels and apartments. I find it plausible that additional experience expands comfort level. But I&rsquo;d be gentle when just starting out. Too many hardships at once could become unbearable.</p>

<h2>16. Captain &ldquo;Spoke&rdquo;</h2>

<p>When the team gets large enough (3+ members) choose a predetermined person as a captain, or a leader. In times of doubt and turmoil everyone should contribute but the captain must be given authority to make decisions and the rest of the team should unconditionally accept them. It does not matter than the captain could be wrong now and then. What matters more is that the team does not pursue too many options and argue much.</p>

<p>We did not have a captain. Whenever we had navigation issues and were unsure of whether to follow our pre-programmed GPS route or local signs we got into lengthy draining arguments, especially as exhaustion piled up on team&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>

<h2>17. Team spirit</h2>

<p>Everyone should stick together and have respect for the effort of others. Here&rsquo;s an example. Somebody decides to skip a leg of a route while the rest toils through a storm and additional hundred or so kilometers, arrives at midnight in a terrible city. This person should not make decisions of what to do the next day. This person should stay quiet and keep his replenished heroism and enthusiasm to himself.</p>

<p>Be prepared for conflicts of interest. Everyone has their own ideas of fun. Some might like to take a dirt road. Others prefer the smooth pavement. It&rsquo;s not always possible to please everyone so either have strict planning or agree to catch up somewhere along the route later.</p>

<h2>18. Praise the rain gear</h2>

<p>It is surprising just how efficient modern good water-proof clothing is and how protected the rider is from the elements. Gradually, piece by piece I bought a whole set: pants, jacket, helmet cover, gloves, shoe gaters. I could not swallow the total price of the whole kit at once because quality membrane materials are expensive. But worth every penny!</p>

<p>We rode through several storms and rain poured almost non stop the last couple of days. Clothing made out of modern materials save the rider from the water yet are sufficiently breathable. Depending on the climate and the time of the year it&rsquo;s possible to combine outer layers with inner layers to achieve the right amount of warmth.</p>

<p>One set of clothes is absolutely sufficient. I regret I took extra clothing with me. Layers and extra pieces of clothing can be combined for the changing circumstances in almost infinite ways. Extra sets of underwear might come handy but that&rsquo;s about it.</p>

<h2>19. The Zen</h2>

<p>The joy of touring is to be present in the moment of cycling and not to think about the destination much. If you find yourself constantly thinking about racing ahead just to get to the next point quicker something has gone wrong.</p>

<h1>In place of conclusion</h1>

<p>This short collection of insights is all I&rsquo;ve jotted down on our train back from Rotterdam to Zürich following a controversial and memorable biking experience. It is by no means extensive or advanced but it might give you an idea of what problems to expect on your first self organized bicycle tour. Hopefully you will prepare adequately and most of the issues we had in our tour won&rsquo;t happen in your next amazing adventure.</p>

<p>As for us, we can&rsquo;t wait for 2015. We&rsquo;re not yet planning but we&rsquo;re already excited about the next great biking adventure. This time we&rsquo;ll be hopefully dealing with a completely new set of challenging problems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I have given up on many tools, devices and services to simplify my life and focus on doing things, rather than focusing on maintaining the tools themselves. I used to rely on a R program to calculate investments according to the Ivy Portfolio model. The program ran in a lxc environment on a home headless PC. I decided to use a simpler solution so I made a Google Spreadsheet to make the calculations. As it turns out, the previous complexity was completely unnecessary.</p>

<p>Without further ado, below are the results for month November 2014:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Instrument      Avg return      Invested?
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>VNQ             11.34%          Yes
</span><span class='line'>MTUM            9.81%           Yes
</span><span class='line'>VGLT            8.16%           Yes</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If there&rsquo;s any interest I can share my spreadsheet publicly. It is based on the work from the &ldquo;Investing for a living&rdquo; blog. I&rsquo;ve cleaned it up, removed the parts I don&rsquo;t need and made it easy to change instruments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>2014 is a pivotal year in my cycling &ldquo;career&rdquo;. I went on my first multi-day tour. I went on my first multi-week tour.
I&rsquo;ve set a personal distance record. And I&rsquo;ve set a personal vertical ascent record. Admittedly, I did not do the best job
documenting and sharing. But I digress.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May 2014 me and a 4 friends from work embarked on a biking trip from Andermatt, Switzerland, to Rotterdam, Netherlands,
along the river Rhine. The total planned length of the route was about 1,400 Km. What followed was an example from the book on how
to NOT do bicycle touring. Despite the setbacks I enjoyed the experience and, if anything, it made me stronger and better prepared
for the future tours.</p>

<p>Most of what I have written applies to touring in Europe. Some of the points don&rsquo;t apply to remote and exotic places.</p>

<h2>1. On expectations</h2>

<p>Never being in a long bike tour before I did not know what to expect. Media of our day emphasizes results and achievements and
almost never talks about the mundane, the boring and the unexciting. Basically, we hear and talk about the &lt;1% of things
(likely, &lt;0.0001%). Extending this to bike touring makes us imagine ourself covering insane distances in the most severe
conditions and coming out of it as heroes. The reality is that it&rsquo;s not glamorous and the result does not matter. HOW one rides,
I argue, is more important than reaching some arbitrary target. I argue that a team that exceeds their goal but looses few teammates
along the way due to poor preparation or poor judgment constitutes a failure.</p>

<p>I wish I could be excused for the absent mindedness I had. I held wrong ideas about mindfulness and enjoyment of the present. None of
these obviate the need for excruciating planning and preparations. I must stop immediately if I ever find myself romanticizing
any serious undertakings again.</p>

<p>With that said, let&rsquo;s get down to business.</p>

<h2>2. Planning is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility</h2>

<p>Someone must take the responsibility for planning but every member of the team must review and understand most of the plans. Our biggest
issue was incorrect distance estimation. We calculated distances using Google Maps that chose the shortest cycling paths instead of the
specific route that we intended to follow. We had to ride 25-50% more than originally planned almost every day. Yes, it was cool to cover 208Km in
one day but it was uncool to have team mates regularly getting off the route to take rest and catch-up on trains. The original plan was
simply unrealistic. 2 out of 5 finished, albeit few days later. 1 out of 5 finished from start to finish without getting off the route.</p>

<p>Next time, I&rsquo;m going to breathe our plans. I&rsquo;m going to go through every day, through every kilometer, through every vertical meter.</p>

<h2>3. Unload &frac12; or more of gear</h2>

<p>Seriously. Don&rsquo;t take any food. Buy it at the supermarket in the morning. Don&rsquo;t take extra clothes beyond bare minimum. You don&rsquo;t need
everyday clothes to walk around towns. Combine layers and functional clothing to adapt to changing weather conditions.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t carry extra heavy bike locks. There&rsquo;s no need for any electronics, such as tablets, laptops and DSLRs. Because you are riding,
and not browsing the web or making studio shots. Your smartphone is sufficient for most tasks. Perhaps take an external battery
but that&rsquo;s about it.</p>

<p>I had no problem lugging lots of weight around but it felt inelegant and wasteful. I actually sent 10Kg worth of gear by post on the
second day of the tour.</p>

<p>Also, try to leverage your team. If, after all, you find a need to carry a laptop or a DSLR share the load and don&rsquo;t take multiples.
Share the weight between members.</p>

<h2>4. Choose small substitutes and tiny packages</h2>

<p>It may be ridiculous to buy miniature bottles of shampoo that cost as much as large ones. But it&rsquo;s also ridiculous to carry 0.5-1Kg of
shampoo for the sake of using few grams. And it&rsquo;s possible to get miniature containers for free or cheaply.</p>

<p>I also found that soap is good enough for all my washing needs for the duration of the tour. Not only can I take a shower but I also
have something to wash my bike with! And, best of all, it&rsquo;s small and compact.</p>

<h2>5. Mechanical failures to be expected</h2>

<p>If you never had mechanical failures and you think it&rsquo;s something others are going to experience I have bad news. In a long tour, and especially
in larger groups, failures are more likely to occur. You personally might not have any major break-downs but your team mate might. So the
team must be prepared to fix simple problems on the go and to improvise short-term solutions to get to the next bike shop for more serious
issues.</p>

<p>We had chain failures and flats. My bike&rsquo;s frame failed to hold the rack mounts properly. On the second day of the tour the rack tore off
the thread it was attached to between the seat stays. I was able to cleverly attach the rack with 3 zip ties. It worked surprisingly well
and lasted through the remainder of the tour.</p>

<p>Two weeks of consecutive cycling also puts stress on some parts. For example, brake pads on some of the bikes were gone following couple of
days of prolonged descents. I had mechanical disc brakes and by the end of the tour the pads were so far from the rotors that the bike had
zero stopping power. Knowing how to make basic adjustments is very important.</p>

<h2>6. Don&rsquo;t ride a new bike &hellip;and be prepared when you do</h2>

<p>It is better to take a trusted bicycle you have extensively ridden before, preferably hard. It&rsquo;s difficult to resist a shiny a new bike and
I did exactly this mistake. Instead of riding the bike I had for 3 years I chose to build a new custom one from parts. Obviously, I could not
resist the temptation of the new fancy drop-bar bike.</p>

<p>When you take a new a bike for a tour be prepared to deal with adjustments to gears, brakes and seating position (more on that later). Furthermore,
loose bolts and poorly-placed accessories will make themselves known very quickly. My brakes were not bedded in, the cables were not stretched
and there was a huge risk with a lightweight kick-stand that attached to the rear quick-release skewer. The kick-stand unscrewed the rear wheel
slowly so hypothetically the wheel could go off while I was in a fast descent.</p>

<p>If you decide to take a new machine for the ride then go for a couple of longish test rides, preferably with sufficient ascents and descents
and with the full gear on (e.g. racks with panniers loaded with weight).</p>

<h2>7. Comfort is likely going to play larger role than your fitness</h2>

<p>I was well aware of this one. Most blogs and magazines about touring say that the comfort is the number one reason riders pause their tours and
take breaks. After a couple of 150-200KM days any comfort and ergonomics issues surface quickly. Here&rsquo;s a collective list (of which I experienced
almost all):</p>

<ul>
<li>knee pain due to wrong saddle height</li>
<li>swollen heel due to incorrect fore/aft position</li>
<li>hand numbness (that persisted for several months after the tour)</li>
<li>butt pain</li>
</ul>


<p>Many of these issues will not make themselves known in day rides. I have done 150-180KM rides on a setup similar to what I rode in the tour and
felt no pain or discomfort. But 5 consecutive days of 150KM-180KM rides exposed a whole gamut of issues.</p>

<p>I believe this one is hard to prepare for. My current bike is setup much more ergonomically and I believe I will not experience the same issues
should I go on the exact same route. My recipe: a better seat (Brooks C17), a suspended seat post (Ergon CF-3 or Cane Creek ST) and a suspension
fork (RockShox Reba 100mm).</p>

<h2>8. Carry spares</h2>

<p>Things break and wear out. At a minimum I recommend having: tubes, zip ties, electric tape, a chain, chain links, shift cable, break cable, disc
rotor and break pads. Obviously, a set of tools is required to be able to install the spares, should something break.</p>

<p>Most of my team mates were oblivious to the possibility of things breaking down. Right up to the second day when a chain got torn apart on one of the
bikes.</p>

<p>This is a bigger issue for tours destined to exotic and remote places. While bike shops are on every corner in Europe getting assistance and spares
for fancy bike components could be problematic in, say, Africa. It may be a good idea to ride a bike with simpler and popular parts when going really
far.</p>

<h2>9. Plan sensible distances</h2>

<p>Plan distances rationally. On a flat surface 120-140KM is a reasonable distance to cover in one day. Perhaps even less if you would like to have
any time for something but cycling.</p>

<p>Detours quickly add up. It was not uncommon to have 20-30KM extra due to detours, either because of road closures or navigation mistakes.</p>

<h2>10. Plan for &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; days</h2>

<p>Cycling non-stop for 7+ days is exhausting. Our bodies need rest. If we keep riding hard and far every day we&rsquo;ll come late, wake up later and then
arrive even later the day after. It&rsquo;s a vicious cycle of mental and physical depletion. To avoid a break down it&rsquo;s essential to plan for &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo;
or &ldquo;no cycle&rdquo; days. It could be a good day to spend on a beach, forest, camp, lake, SPA, city center or anything you fancy. Just don&rsquo;t bike. Sleep
and eat a lot.</p>

<p>If possible, try to make the plans flexible to accommodate &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; days when you need them the most.</p>

<p>We had 0 breaks planned. And it showed. On 8th day me and another team mate had a break-down. We rode for 160km that day through storms and arrived
at 10pm in one of the worst places I ever had stay in. We finished our dinner at midnight. Our clothes were dirty and wet and there was absolutely
no energy to do anything. The only way we could finish our tour in time was to wake up and leave at 4am and cycle for 2 more days, 200KM each. Needless
to say, that was the end of the tour for me and another mate. The other guys took extra days to reach the destination.</p>

<h2>11. Getting the difficulty curve right</h2>

<p>We made a mistake of planning too little for our first days. It seemed reasonable to us to leave the first couple of days to ramp up. Well, we had 2
days where we arrived at 4pm and then tried to find something to amuse ourselves with. Some went as far as doing nothing but playing with their tablets
in the comfort of the accommodation.</p>

<p>Compare this to the days that followed: arriving exhausted at midnight after having cycled for 160-180KM. It makes more sense to push a little more
while you are fresh. This goes hand in hand with the previous insight. It&rsquo;s crucial to get the rhythm right.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Switzerland-Germany-Denmark-Sweden-Norway-Latvia-Lithuania-Poland-Czech-Germany-Switzerland, day T-1!</p>

<p>Phew, that was a mouthful. Tomorrow I am leaving for a 4 week motorcycle tour across Europe heading to the North. Every summer for the past couple of years I was swearing that next year I am going to be somewhere North, rather than elbowing annoying tourists in the Southern honeypot tourist traps. Finally, I am doing it!</p>

<p>I have been dreaming of this trip for years. I am not going to lie and say that I planned this trip in detail. I feel quite unprepared and I did very little preparation. I don&rsquo;t have a specific plan in mind and I have not booked any accommodation in advance (with a few notable exceptions). My dear wife has kindly written a whole tour book for me with a collection of interesting places to visit, route suggestions and tips. She currently knows a lot more about my adventure than me. She is not enthused with sleeping in a tent and sitting on a bike for hours at a time so I am doing this trip alone. I will meet her on my way back and we&rsquo;re going to spend time together doing comfortable stuff, like visiting SPAs and staying at fancy hotels. To each his own!</p>

<p>Today is a public holiday and Switzerland. I am packing today. I am going to leave tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>I woke up with a hang-over from yesterday&rsquo;s corporate summer party and an allergic reaction to all the plant shit that&rsquo;s flying around. I pack slowly and sometimes I just sit for 10 minutes doing nothing. Not the best of starts.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the preparation war room looks like at the moment:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/14112675638/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3819/14112675638_e90c558520.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/14112678518/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5513/14112678518_7dc49def62.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I am packing everything into two BMW side aluminum panniers and a 80L backpack strapped on top of the panniers. Combined, the volume of panniers is 80L. I also have a tank bag which I am going to use for valuables and gadgets.</p>

<p>My red beauty:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/14299339415/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5573/14299339415_1d149cbba0.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/14112636139/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5590/14112636139_e052f4c5cd.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/14276196936/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3666/14276196936_be5262cf7e.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The bike is brand new and just out of its first 1000km service. I consider myself somewhat of a newbie rider and I don&rsquo;t have vast riding experience. This does not hold me back.</p>

<p>Tank bag with ingenious charging solution. My bike provides a power outlet for plugging in accessories. By scouting forums and eBay I found a cool adapter that plugs into the outlet and provides two car cigarette sockets. Then I&rsquo;ve plugged two high-power 2-port USB chargers into the sockets. I can charge 4 devices at a time while on the go! I also found a cigarette charger for my laptop which means I am completely self-sufficient with the power.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/14295984991/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3830/14295984991_38c2993b20.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/14112645989/"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2921/14112645989_60367f9fee.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I am going to keep a trip journal but I am not going to update the blog while riding.</p>
