  <div class="entry-content"><p>&hellip;continued from <a href="/blog/2014/12/03/what-i-learned-from-a-10-day-bicycle-tour/">part 1</a>.</p>

<h2>12. Nutrition and hydration</h2>

<p>Regular nutrition is key to riding sustainably for many kilometers. In the morning or the previous evening you should stock up on dried fruit, bananas, bars and other snacks. I can ride for many hours if I eat something small every hour or so.</p>

<p>Big meals are great but they are time consuming. There&rsquo;s also a fat chance of overeating. I recommend planning for dinner and nothing else.</p>

<p>Drinking plenty of water is essential. Without sufficient hydration you will get tired too quickly. I had a camelbak and two extra water bottles. Even in Europe water fountains could be hard to come by.</p>

<h2>13. Team tempo</h2>

<p>People have varying fitness levels so their comfortable cruising speeds differ. Riding at the slowest common speed might not be the best strategy because riding slower than it is comfortable could be straining. And when the route is challenging and not everyone has a GPS it is hard to coordinate catch-ups.</p>

<p>I had terrible pain in my butt so I preferred to race ahead for about an hour and then take a 10 minute brake. It was the time in the saddle which was the hardest for me. As you can imagine, we got lost regularly but miraculously were able to catch up each and every day.</p>

<h2>14. Leave early, arrive early</h2>

<p>Leave early and arrive early. Leave at 8:30 the latest and plan to arrive before 18:00. This means that you should plan to leave at 8. Anytime later is a recipe for spiraling late arrival. There won&rsquo;t be enough time to rest, to take care of the body and the bikes.</p>

<h2>15. Accommodation</h2>

<p>Choose the best accommodation you can. Places that allow to relax and wind down. When I&rsquo;m stressed because a place is smelly, cramped and dirty I won&rsquo;t rest. And I will be tired the following day.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to book separate rooms. Some people prefer to leave the bedroom window open to let fresh air in. Others feel too cold. Some snore. Others find it hard to fall asleep.</p>

<p>Accommodation is a matter of personal choice. Some people prefer to camp or stay in hostels. On this tour I wish we had chosen better hotels and apartments. I find it plausible that additional experience expands comfort level. But I&rsquo;d be gentle when just starting out. Too many hardships at once could become unbearable.</p>

<h2>16. Captain &ldquo;Spoke&rdquo;</h2>

<p>When the team gets large enough (3+ members) choose a predetermined person as a captain, or a leader. In times of doubt and turmoil everyone should contribute but the captain must be given authority to make decisions and the rest of the team should unconditionally accept them. It does not matter than the captain could be wrong now and then. What matters more is that the team does not pursue too many options and argue much.</p>

<p>We did not have a captain. Whenever we had navigation issues and were unsure of whether to follow our pre-programmed GPS route or local signs we got into lengthy draining arguments, especially as exhaustion piled up on team&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>

<h2>17. Team spirit</h2>

<p>Everyone should stick together and have respect for the effort of others. Here&rsquo;s an example. Somebody decides to skip a leg of a route while the rest toils through a storm and additional hundred or so kilometers, arrives at midnight in a terrible city. This person should not make decisions of what to do the next day. This person should stay quiet and keep his replenished heroism and enthusiasm to himself.</p>

<p>Be prepared for conflicts of interest. Everyone has their own ideas of fun. Some might like to take a dirt road. Others prefer the smooth pavement. It&rsquo;s not always possible to please everyone so either have strict planning or agree to catch up somewhere along the route later.</p>

<h2>18. Praise the rain gear</h2>

<p>It is surprising just how efficient modern good water-proof clothing is and how protected the rider is from the elements. Gradually, piece by piece I bought a whole set: pants, jacket, helmet cover, gloves, shoe gaters. I could not swallow the total price of the whole kit at once because quality membrane materials are expensive. But worth every penny!</p>

<p>We rode through several storms and rain poured almost non stop the last couple of days. Clothing made out of modern materials save the rider from the water yet are sufficiently breathable. Depending on the climate and the time of the year it&rsquo;s possible to combine outer layers with inner layers to achieve the right amount of warmth.</p>

<p>One set of clothes is absolutely sufficient. I regret I took extra clothing with me. Layers and extra pieces of clothing can be combined for the changing circumstances in almost infinite ways. Extra sets of underwear might come handy but that&rsquo;s about it.</p>

<h2>19. The Zen</h2>

<p>The joy of touring is to be present in the moment of cycling and not to think about the destination much. If you find yourself constantly thinking about racing ahead just to get to the next point quicker something has gone wrong.</p>

<h1>In place of conclusion</h1>

<p>This short collection of insights is all I&rsquo;ve jotted down on our train back from Rotterdam to Zürich following a controversial and memorable biking experience. It is by no means extensive or advanced but it might give you an idea of what problems to expect on your first self organized bicycle tour. Hopefully you will prepare adequately and most of the issues we had in our tour won&rsquo;t happen in your next amazing adventure.</p>

<p>As for us, we can&rsquo;t wait for 2015. We&rsquo;re not yet planning but we&rsquo;re already excited about the next great biking adventure. This time we&rsquo;ll be hopefully dealing with a completely new set of challenging problems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I have given up on many tools, devices and services to simplify my life and focus on doing things, rather than focusing on maintaining the tools themselves. I used to rely on a R program to calculate investments according to the Ivy Portfolio model. The program ran in a lxc environment on a home headless PC. I decided to use a simpler solution so I made a Google Spreadsheet to make the calculations. As it turns out, the previous complexity was completely unnecessary.</p>

<p>Without further ado, below are the results for month November 2014:</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s any interest I can share my spreadsheet publicly. It is based on the work from the &ldquo;Investing for a living&rdquo; blog. I&rsquo;ve cleaned it up, removed the parts I don&rsquo;t need and made it easy to change instruments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>2014 is a pivotal year in my cycling &ldquo;career&rdquo;. I went on my first multi-day tour. I went on my first multi-week tour.
I&rsquo;ve set a personal distance record. And I&rsquo;ve set a personal vertical ascent record. Admittedly, I did not do the best job
documenting and sharing. But I digress.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May 2014 me and a 4 friends from work embarked on a biking trip from Andermatt, Switzerland, to Rotterdam, Netherlands,
along the river Rhine. The total planned length of the route was about 1,400 Km. What followed was an example from the book on how
to NOT do bicycle touring. Despite the setbacks I enjoyed the experience and, if anything, it made me stronger and better prepared
for the future tours.</p>

<p>Most of what I have written applies to touring in Europe. Some of the points don&rsquo;t apply to remote and exotic places.</p>

<h2>1. On expectations</h2>

<p>Never being in a long bike tour before I did not know what to expect. Media of our day emphasizes results and achievements and
almost never talks about the mundane, the boring and the unexciting. Basically, we hear and talk about the &lt;1% of things
(likely, &lt;0.0001%). Extending this to bike touring makes us imagine ourself covering insane distances in the most severe
conditions and coming out of it as heroes. The reality is that it&rsquo;s not glamorous and the result does not matter. HOW one rides,
I argue, is more important than reaching some arbitrary target. I argue that a team that exceeds their goal but looses few teammates
along the way due to poor preparation or poor judgment constitutes a failure.</p>

<p>I wish I could be excused for the absent mindedness I had. I held wrong ideas about mindfulness and enjoyment of the present. None of
these obviate the need for excruciating planning and preparations. I must stop immediately if I ever find myself romanticizing
any serious undertakings again.</p>

<p>With that said, let&rsquo;s get down to business.</p>

<h2>2. Planning is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility</h2>

<p>Someone must take the responsibility for planning but every member of the team must review and understand most of the plans. Our biggest
issue was incorrect distance estimation. We calculated distances using Google Maps that chose the shortest cycling paths instead of the
specific route that we intended to follow. We had to ride 25-50% more than originally planned almost every day. Yes, it was cool to cover 208Km in
one day but it was uncool to have team mates regularly getting off the route to take rest and catch-up on trains. The original plan was
simply unrealistic. 2 out of 5 finished, albeit few days later. 1 out of 5 finished from start to finish without getting off the route.</p>

<p>Next time, I&rsquo;m going to breathe our plans. I&rsquo;m going to go through every day, through every kilometer, through every vertical meter.</p>

<h2>3. Unload &frac12; or more of gear</h2>

<p>Seriously. Don&rsquo;t take any food. Buy it at the supermarket in the morning. Don&rsquo;t take extra clothes beyond bare minimum. You don&rsquo;t need
everyday clothes to walk around towns. Combine layers and functional clothing to adapt to changing weather conditions.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t carry extra heavy bike locks. There&rsquo;s no need for any electronics, such as tablets, laptops and DSLRs. Because you are riding,
and not browsing the web or making studio shots. Your smartphone is sufficient for most tasks. Perhaps take an external battery
but that&rsquo;s about it.</p>

<p>I had no problem lugging lots of weight around but it felt inelegant and wasteful. I actually sent 10Kg worth of gear by post on the
second day of the tour.</p>

<p>Also, try to leverage your team. If, after all, you find a need to carry a laptop or a DSLR share the load and don&rsquo;t take multiples.
Share the weight between members.</p>

<h2>4. Choose small substitutes and tiny packages</h2>

<p>It may be ridiculous to buy miniature bottles of shampoo that cost as much as large ones. But it&rsquo;s also ridiculous to carry 0.5-1Kg of
shampoo for the sake of using few grams. And it&rsquo;s possible to get miniature containers for free or cheaply.</p>

<p>I also found that soap is good enough for all my washing needs for the duration of the tour. Not only can I take a shower but I also
have something to wash my bike with! And, best of all, it&rsquo;s small and compact.</p>

<h2>5. Mechanical failures to be expected</h2>

<p>If you never had mechanical failures and you think it&rsquo;s something others are going to experience I have bad news. In a long tour, and especially
in larger groups, failures are more likely to occur. You personally might not have any major break-downs but your team mate might. So the
team must be prepared to fix simple problems on the go and to improvise short-term solutions to get to the next bike shop for more serious
issues.</p>

<p>We had chain failures and flats. My bike&rsquo;s frame failed to hold the rack mounts properly. On the second day of the tour the rack tore off
the thread it was attached to between the seat stays. I was able to cleverly attach the rack with 3 zip ties. It worked surprisingly well
and lasted through the remainder of the tour.</p>

<p>Two weeks of consecutive cycling also puts stress on some parts. For example, brake pads on some of the bikes were gone following couple of
days of prolonged descents. I had mechanical disc brakes and by the end of the tour the pads were so far from the rotors that the bike had
zero stopping power. Knowing how to make basic adjustments is very important.</p>

<h2>6. Don&rsquo;t ride a new bike &hellip;and be prepared when you do</h2>

<p>It is better to take a trusted bicycle you have extensively ridden before, preferably hard. It&rsquo;s difficult to resist a shiny a new bike and
I did exactly this mistake. Instead of riding the bike I had for 3 years I chose to build a new custom one from parts. Obviously, I could not
resist the temptation of the new fancy drop-bar bike.</p>

<p>When you take a new a bike for a tour be prepared to deal with adjustments to gears, brakes and seating position (more on that later). Furthermore,
loose bolts and poorly-placed accessories will make themselves known very quickly. My brakes were not bedded in, the cables were not stretched
and there was a huge risk with a lightweight kick-stand that attached to the rear quick-release skewer. The kick-stand unscrewed the rear wheel
slowly so hypothetically the wheel could go off while I was in a fast descent.</p>

<p>If you decide to take a new machine for the ride then go for a couple of longish test rides, preferably with sufficient ascents and descents
and with the full gear on (e.g. racks with panniers loaded with weight).</p>

<h2>7. Comfort is likely going to play larger role than your fitness</h2>

<p>I was well aware of this one. Most blogs and magazines about touring say that the comfort is the number one reason riders pause their tours and
take breaks. After a couple of 150-200KM days any comfort and ergonomics issues surface quickly. Here&rsquo;s a collective list (of which I experienced
almost all):</p>

<ul>
<li>knee pain due to wrong saddle height</li>
<li>swollen heel due to incorrect fore/aft position</li>
<li>hand numbness (that persisted for several months after the tour)</li>
<li>butt pain</li>
</ul>


<p>Many of these issues will not make themselves known in day rides. I have done 150-180KM rides on a setup similar to what I rode in the tour and
felt no pain or discomfort. But 5 consecutive days of 150KM-180KM rides exposed a whole gamut of issues.</p>

<p>I believe this one is hard to prepare for. My current bike is setup much more ergonomically and I believe I will not experience the same issues
should I go on the exact same route. My recipe: a better seat (Brooks C17), a suspended seat post (Ergon CF-3 or Cane Creek ST) and a suspension
fork (RockShox Reba 100mm).</p>

<h2>8. Carry spares</h2>

<p>Things break and wear out. At a minimum I recommend having: tubes, zip ties, electric tape, a chain, chain links, shift cable, break cable, disc
rotor and break pads. Obviously, a set of tools is required to be able to install the spares, should something break.</p>

<p>Most of my team mates were oblivious to the possibility of things breaking down. Right up to the second day when a chain got torn apart on one of the
bikes.</p>

<p>This is a bigger issue for tours destined to exotic and remote places. While bike shops are on every corner in Europe getting assistance and spares
for fancy bike components could be problematic in, say, Africa. It may be a good idea to ride a bike with simpler and popular parts when going really
far.</p>

<h2>9. Plan sensible distances</h2>

<p>Plan distances rationally. On a flat surface 120-140KM is a reasonable distance to cover in one day. Perhaps even less if you would like to have
any time for something but cycling.</p>

<p>Detours quickly add up. It was not uncommon to have 20-30KM extra due to detours, either because of road closures or navigation mistakes.</p>

<h2>10. Plan for &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; days</h2>

<p>Cycling non-stop for 7+ days is exhausting. Our bodies need rest. If we keep riding hard and far every day we&rsquo;ll come late, wake up later and then
arrive even later the day after. It&rsquo;s a vicious cycle of mental and physical depletion. To avoid a break down it&rsquo;s essential to plan for &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo;
or &ldquo;no cycle&rdquo; days. It could be a good day to spend on a beach, forest, camp, lake, SPA, city center or anything you fancy. Just don&rsquo;t bike. Sleep
and eat a lot.</p>

<p>If possible, try to make the plans flexible to accommodate &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; days when you need them the most.</p>

<p>We had 0 breaks planned. And it showed. On 8th day me and another team mate had a break-down. We rode for 160km that day through storms and arrived
at 10pm in one of the worst places I ever had stay in. We finished our dinner at midnight. Our clothes were dirty and wet and there was absolutely
no energy to do anything. The only way we could finish our tour in time was to wake up and leave at 4am and cycle for 2 more days, 200KM each. Needless
to say, that was the end of the tour for me and another mate. The other guys took extra days to reach the destination.</p>

<h2>11. Getting the difficulty curve right</h2>

<p>We made a mistake of planning too little for our first days. It seemed reasonable to us to leave the first couple of days to ramp up. Well, we had 2
days where we arrived at 4pm and then tried to find something to amuse ourselves with. Some went as far as doing nothing but playing with their tablets
in the comfort of the accommodation.</p>

<p>Compare this to the days that followed: arriving exhausted at midnight after having cycled for 160-180KM. It makes more sense to push a little more
while you are fresh. This goes hand in hand with the previous insight. It&rsquo;s crucial to get the rhythm right.</p>

<h2>To be continued</h2>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Switzerland-Germany-Denmark-Sweden-Norway-Latvia-Lithuania-Poland-Czech-Germany-Switzerland, day T-1!</p>

<p>Phew, that was a mouthful. Tomorrow I am leaving for a 4 week motorcycle tour across Europe heading to the North. Every summer for the past couple of years I was swearing that next year I am going to be somewhere North, rather than elbowing annoying tourists in the Southern honeypot tourist traps. Finally, I am doing it!</p>

<p>I have been dreaming of this trip for years. I am not going to lie and say that I planned this trip in detail. I feel quite unprepared and I did very little preparation. I don&rsquo;t have a specific plan in mind and I have not booked any accommodation in advance (with a few notable exceptions). My dear wife has kindly written a whole tour book for me with a collection of interesting places to visit, route suggestions and tips. She currently knows a lot more about my adventure than me. She is not enthused with sleeping in a tent and sitting on a bike for hours at a time so I am doing this trip alone. I will meet her on my way back and we&rsquo;re going to spend time together doing comfortable stuff, like visiting SPAs and staying at fancy hotels. To each his own!</p>

<p>Today is a public holiday and Switzerland. I am packing today. I am going to leave tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>I woke up with a hang-over from yesterday&rsquo;s corporate summer party and an allergic reaction to all the plant shit that&rsquo;s flying around. I pack slowly and sometimes I just sit for 10 minutes doing nothing. Not the best of starts.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the preparation war room looks like at the moment:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/14112675638/"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3819/14112675638_e90c558520.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I am packing everything into two BMW side aluminum panniers and a 80L backpack strapped on top of the panniers. Combined, the volume of panniers is 80L. I also have a tank bag which I am going to use for valuables and gadgets.</p>

<p>My red beauty:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/14299339415/"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5573/14299339415_1d149cbba0.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The bike is brand new and just out of its first 1000km service. I consider myself somewhat of a newbie rider and I don&rsquo;t have vast riding experience. This does not hold me back.</p>

<p>Tank bag with ingenious charging solution. My bike provides a power outlet for plugging in accessories. By scouting forums and eBay I found a cool adapter that plugs into the outlet and provides two car cigarette sockets. Then I&rsquo;ve plugged two high-power 2-port USB chargers into the sockets. I can charge 4 devices at a time while on the go! I also found a cigarette charger for my laptop which means I am completely self-sufficient with the power.</p>

<p>I am going to keep a trip journal but I am not going to update the blog while riding.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the part 3 of cyclocross bicycle build series. <a href="/blog/2014/04/13/cyclo-cross-bicycle-build-part-2/">Jump to part 2</a>.</p>

<p>I briefly mentioned in one of the previous posts that I am building this bike specifically for touring around Switzerland and Europe. Together with a couple of colleagues we went on a bike tour from Andermatt, Switzerland to Rotterdam, Netherlands along the Rhine river. I&rsquo;ll be covering the tour separately in a series of posts. In this post, however, I would like to share lessons learned from the building process and the bike itself.</p>

<p>I call the bike make 1 because through the tour experience I came up with list of upgrades that are going to make the bike better for the intended purpose, hence make 2. First, it was not a brilliant idea to take an untested bike in a long tour. Of course, everything that can go wrong went wrong. Also, some mechanical parts require a break-in period. I knew this from before but still went on the new bike &ndash; who can resist new and shiny?</p>

<h2>Failures</h2>

<p>The first major issue were the tires. Originally, I was planning to use tubeless cyclo-cross off-road knobby tires. Knowing that most of the roads on the tour are paved I scrambled to get Hutchinson Sector 28 tubeless road tires. However, the new tires could not resist the off-road sections along the river on the way to Chur on the day 2 for too long. I had a side puncture. As a quick solution I&rsquo;ve put in a tube and made a mental note to purchase suitable tires in the next bike shop along the way. I&rsquo;ve made a big mistake when putting the tire on. The tire did not sit evenly so the bike convulsed uncomfortably on every revolution of the wheel. I realized where the mistake was only after I finished the whole tour. Luckily, I&rsquo;ve purchased good 35c tires that day and put them on.</p>

<p>The off-road sections had put a lot of strain on other parts too. Later at night as I was cleaning the bike and replacing the tires I noticed that the rear rack had torn out the whole thread from the frame (the middle hole where canti-levers are mounted on canti-lever frames). The rack could not fall off completely but it could move along the axis for a few centimeters. Clearly, the frame hole was not intended for a loaded rack. I almost thought of taking train back home to take another bike. Instead, I went for the proven zip-tie solution. I used 3 zip ties to secure the failed point to the frame. Part of the solution was to send half of the panniers weight back home by post. I wanted to complete the tour completely and the zip-tie work-around, while not ideal, should have lasted until the finish line.</p>

<p>On a descent following the catastrophic off-road I felt the convulsions of the bike. I did not know at the time that the convulsions were caused by a misaligned rear tire. I stopped for a break to check the bike. Bolts holding the rear rack were all loosened and the rack was viciously swinging from left to right. I also did not notice the frame rack mount failure because the bike was wholly covered with mud.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I discovered that the rear quick release axle was loose! Talk about catastrophic failures on descents! I believe the issue had been caused by the upstand accessory. I would not recommend anyone to use it. I think the problem is fundamental and cannot be worked-around. The bike under its own weight will push on the stand and slowly unscrew the axle. Obviously, it will happen sooner on a loaded bike. But I would never use upstand again even on a lightweight bike.</p>

<p>Less dramatic issues included normal component wear. For example, shifting and braking cables stretch and the drivetrain must be adjusted as a result. This wear becomes noticeable after a 1000km. Gearing on the bike generally worked well and allowed me to climb all hills without an issue. However, I feel that the 50t chainring could be smaller. I had no use for the smallest rear sprockets.</p>

<p>I felt my saddle a bit too well and my hands told me that the handlebar could be just a tad higher. Every incorrect ergonomic setup will make itself known when you ride 140-200km per day. Muscles were nowhere close to limits as my ass and hands were. No wonder experienced tourers will tell you that saddle time is the prevalent factor rather than fatigue or leg muscles.</p>

<h2>Improvements, aka Cube Cross Disc Touring Custom Mk2</h2>

<p>As I discovered the failures and inefficiencies I came up with a list of improvements for make 2 that I am going to present in a separate post. I replaced 30% of the bike and the only part remaining from the original bike is the frameset.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t resist the feeling that building a bicycle from scratch is wasteful. Yes, I have learned lots of things along the way but I also ended up with lots of bike parts that I don&rsquo;t need. I can understand why custom bikes become expensive. The part prices are not necessarily very high but you choose better components than the manufacturer would. And sometimes it&rsquo;s impossible to know if a given part will fit in the unique combination without trial and error.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I always had passion for motorbikes, especially so because everyone around me tried to prevent me from riding as I was growing up. I have started riding motorcycles just 3 years ago not knowing what to expect. I was not sure about whether I want to ride sport bikes or off-road monsters or touring rigs or choppers. Last year I went to a 2 day training camp at <a href="http://www.superbikeschool.com/curriculum/two-day-camps.php">California Superbike School</a> to their Las Vegas Motor Speedway offering. I&rsquo;ve learned skills to handle a powerful BMW S1000RR superbike around the track. Without question, those two days will forever remain a highlight of my life. The training was intensive, well organized and valuable. But I realized that track racing is out of reach for me. Not only there are no racing circuits around where I live it&rsquo;s a also demanding financial burden &ndash; tires, circuit fees, a car to haul the bike, repairs, upgrades, etc. Racing on public roads seems inexcusably dangerous so racing bikes seem a bit pointless. I even sold my bike and thought of calling motorcyling a day. And of course a couple of months later I got the riding itch. After due introspection I understood that touring is what I long for. I love seeing new places, especially if these places are not staples of modern disposable tourism.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s me on the track:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/8724381030/in/set-72157633457951920"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7452/8724381030_9d728231bd.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/8724376318/in/set-72157633457951920"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7411/8724376318_40d47aec73_b.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>Later in 2013 with the adventure ideas in my mind I pulled a plug and ordered a BMW F800 GS Adventure motorcycle for delivery this spring. I decided to change the usual habit of visiting southern countries during vacation and re-visit Sweden and Norway since the old days of living there as a student. Furthermore, I booked a whole month off and did as little planning as possible so as not feel restricted by a prescribed agenda. Before getting into riding I signed-up for a course in off-road riding. One well-known training center is located in Germany near a small town called Hechlingen that 150km away from both, Stuttgart and Munich. It&rsquo;s within 4 hours of driving from where I live.</p>

<p>I got a bike like this:</p>

<p><a href="/images/f800gs.jpg"><img src="/images/f800gs.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.enduropark-hechlingen.de/en/home/">Enduro Park Hechlingen</a> is an official partner of BMW. Their <a href="https://www.enduropark-hechlingen.de/en/home/">web-site</a> is comprehensible and easy to use. I highly recommend to book early in advance. I mean 3 or more months early. I was originally planning to attend a two-day training course with a friend of mine but because collectively we postponed it for too long no two-day slots remained available before the tour. Even as we scrambled to sign-up at least for a one-day training my friend did not secure a spot. Ideally, I&rsquo;d book for a weekend but the only remaining option was a Friday.</p>

<p>Enduro Park Hechlingen offers rental bikes but you can also bring your own. From what I have seen during my training I would not recommend anyone to bring their own bike! You&rsquo;ll likely brake a thing or two and the insurance does not cover track days and training courses. Even though I own a bike I opted for renting the exact same model. I&rsquo;ve dropped the bike a couple of times. During the day I&rsquo;ve also seen scratched wind shields, torn blinkers and carnage, just like in the movies: as a biker on his personal Yamaha Tenere pulled in for a stop for a break his bike got of neutral, jerked forward, fell and started spinning. That caused another bike, a BMW 1200 GS to fall causing a domino-like chain reaction with the nearby bikes. I would not want to pay for such damages!</p>

<p>Protective clothing, however, is not offered for rent. You must have your own helmet, jacket, trousers and gloves. Enduro boots are an exception. The park offers them at 15 Euro per day. I rented as enduro boots cost dearly and I was not sure whether I&rsquo;ll do enough off-road riding in the near future to justify the cost. The boot rental is paid on the spot and must be done in cash.</p>

<p>I rented a car for 2 days to get there and stayed in a hotel the night before to feel fresh and rested. I stayed at a nearby town in one of the recommended hotels. Originally, I had booked a different guest house but due to miscommunication the guest house was closed at the late hour that I arrived.</p>

<p>Finding the center in the morning was not difficult and most people own GPS navigators anyway. I arrived 5 minutes before 9 and most participants were already registered and were waiting in full gear for the briefing to begin. The main building is modern, consisting of a lot of glass panels. There are showers and changing rooms with spacious lockers. I recommend to bring a towel because after a day of intense riding your body will long for a refreshing shower.</p>

<p>Once everyone signed-in and took seats around the table instructors introduced themselves. Then, trainees were assigned into 3 groups based on their skills. I got into the beginners group. That was great for two reasons. One, our group was the smallest (about 6) so we got more attention from the instructor. Two, I never rode a bike off-road before. Everyone but me spoke German but all instructors were prepared to converse in English. My German was good enough to understand everything so I have rarely asked for clarification in English. The beginner&rsquo;s group had a female instructor. Despite her petite size she easily maneuvered a BMW 1200 GS! We went to pick our bikes from the stall. Each bike had a label with trainee&rsquo;s name so it was easy to locate the bike. The bikes are in great shape. Some parts, like mirrors, are understandably removed to prevent damage. We started the bikes and followed our instructor.</p>

<p>As the day progressed we learned various off-road skills and did various excercise. There are a couple of small but important things to keep in mind. Those were repeated many many times over the day. For example, to always keep two fingers over the clutch to stall the engine in case something goes wrong. The training sessions were intermixed with rides across the off-road terrain around the park. Those were really fun! At some point we went on single-track and my first reaction was that it&rsquo;s not possible to go on a single-track with a 150+ kg motorcycle. But since I had to follow there was no time to get desperate. The training was physically demanding. I am fit and I felt exhausted by the end of it. For this reason I don&rsquo;t recommend going for a 2 day course unless you&rsquo;ve done a 1 day training before or have sufficient off-road riding experience under your belt.</p>

<p>At lunch we went to a restaurant in a nearby town. The food was already paid for but the drinks were paid for separately. Credit cards were not accepted. After having food we went for fuel and made a stop at a local ATM because I did not bring cash and could not pay for the boots rental.</p>

<p>By the end of the day at around 5pm we returned the bikes to the stall and gathered around the table to cheer for our victory and receive certificates that we successfully finished the training!</p>

<p>I am confident to ride my bike off-road and I am ready for the upcoming tour! Here we go!</p>

</span><span class='line'>9.237548 8.128931 6.267076</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>VEA has replaced VBK as one of the instruments.</p>
