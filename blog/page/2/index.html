  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is part 1 of a series of articles themed &ldquo;Preparing for Software Engineer Interviews&rdquo;. My goal with the series is to document the steps I took while preparing for interviews for a software engineering position after working six years in predominantly support-leaning roles. I won&rsquo;t break new ground here but rather share personal experience &mdash; anything you see here is an echo of what you can find elsewhere on the Internet. But too much of a good thing could be bad. Too much advice obscures itself and makes it hard to navigate. In this part I will explain how I went about refreshing and improving knowledge of algorithms and data structures.</p>

<p>A fancy word makes even the most mundane things sound legitimate. Enter &lsquo;kata&rsquo; &mdash; a fancy way of saying that one does something mundane, regularly. Originally, the Japanese word &lsquo;kata&rsquo; stands for a very specific kind of practice in traditional arts. But in the programming world it&rsquo;s synonymous with a repetitive coding practice. I have no opinion in the linguistic department but I believe the practice might have some substance. Let me rewind a little bit.</p>

<p>Exactly one year ago I <a href="/blog/2015/06/16/why-i-have-quit-an-awesome-job/">left a wonderful job in one of the best places to work</a> on this planet. With such a drastic move there&rsquo;s a multitude of reasons. One of the major ones is my ambition to become an excellent software engineer and steer away from the technical support role I had so far pursued.</p>

<p>The first obstacle on the way are the well-known and sometimes wacky software interviews that most respectable companies seem to rely on for choosing among candidates. To prepare myself for the challenge I devised a multi-month plan. About 3 months ago, as I was done with another full-time endeavour, I put the plan through its paces. In this article I&rsquo;ll do my best to explain the first step of the plan &mdash; the study and practice of algorithms and data-structures.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve never studied algorithms. In fact, I hold a computer science degree and have completed several excellent online algorithm-focused courses with top marks (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI">Algorithms Part I</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII">Algorithms Part II</a>). But annoyingly if you had asked me to implement a path-finding algorithm or even an O(N*LogN) sorting algorithm I would have struggled without referring to technical books or articles. Should you have asked the same question straight after I had just completed the courses I would have absolutely no issues. From a limited personal survey of fellow engineers it is a very common situation. Few keep algorithms in their heads.</p>

<p>Clearly, without an excellent understanding of algorithms passing a coding interview is unlikely. Besides, algorithms and data structures are the cornerstones of computer science and software. Without the understanding of basic structures it&rsquo;s not possible to solve most of the coding challenges. So I dedicated the first month of preparation to the study of algorithms.</p>

<p>However, as I&rsquo;ve already learned, the chosen method of study is critical. It&rsquo;s all to easy to complete a course or a book and then forget everything few weeks after. It is also not sufficient to merely browse through a book or a bunch of articles. Superflous reading creates a perilous illusion of understanding. It is imperative to work through. That&rsquo;s why going through one algorithms book takes a month of full-time effort and not an afternoon. I also emphasize that I had completed algorithm courses before starting this effort. Otherwise, it would make sense to study through the online courses mentioned above first. It would also significantly lengthen the plan.</p>

<p>As there are many more algorithms than the time available to me I had to optimize. It makes little sense to study the most esoteric and domain-specific algorithms for the purpose of preparing for software interviews. I made a survey of interview-related Q&amp;As and websites and came up with the following initial list of algorithms and data structures (in no particular order):</p>

<pre><code>* Stack/Queue (based on LinkedList)
* Selection Sort
* SeparateChainingHashST
* LSD/MSD sort (Radix)
* Graph/Digraph/WeightedGraph
* Edge/EdgeWeightedGraph
* DFS/BFS
* Binary Search
* Weighted Quick Union
* Insertion Sort
* Shell Sort
* DFSPaths/BFSPaths
* Cycle detection in undirected graph
* Connected Components with DFS in undirected graph
* Bipartite check in undirected graph (two color)
* Merge Sort
* Bottom-up Merge Sort
* Quicksort
* 3-way Quicksort
* CountSort
* Min/MaxPQ
* Heapsort
* BST
* Red-black BST
* LinearProbingHashST
* Cycle detection in directed graph
* DFS order and Topological sort
* Kosaraju-Sharir Strong Connected Components in directed graph
* Kruskal MST
* Prim MST
* Dijkstra SP
* Acyclic SP
* Bellman-Ford SP
* Knuth-Morris-Prath search
* Boyer-Moore search
</code></pre>

<p>It is debatable if some of the algorithms in this list are already too complex for general software engineering interviews (knowledge of esoteric algorithms might be required for more senior or specialized roles). In fact, as practice went by I added a few additional ones and removed a few.</p>

<p>The book I chose for my study is &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X">Algorithms, 4th edition</a>&rdquo; from Robert Sedgewick at Princeton University. It&rsquo;s written by the same professor that teaches the corresponding online courses. What sets it apart from other famous algorithm texts is the focus on visually illustrating algorithms and doing algorithm-tracing exercises. Working through an algorithm on paper and tracing all the steps helps to grasp what the algorithm really does. Through these exercises I uncovered that my mental models for some of the algorithms were wrong. The other huge benefit of this book is a <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/">complementary codesite</a> with lots of high-quality and clearly-written implementations of algorithms in Java.</p>

<p>My daily routine consisted of reading about one topic and related algorithms and then trying to re-implement the algorithms myself. As soon as I stumbled I looked-up the text. The complementary code is extremely readable. The implementations may lack some of the fanciest and trickiest optimizations but are invaluable tools for learning. Once I implemented the code I erased and started from scratch, testing thoroughness of my understanding.</p>

<p>As the days went by and I progressed further I felt that I no longer remembered the details of algorithms I had already worked-through. That&rsquo;s when I decided to introduce additional regular algorithm coding practice &mdash; katas. I grouped some of the algorithms together. Then during each practice session I would implement algorithms and data-structures from the top of my head, copying only test cases from the reference implementation. At times I would get stuck. In those moments I learned a little bit more about each algorithm. Often, I would get confused and need to look-up the reference implementation. Next time, though, the practice would become easier and more automatic. Katas keep the algorithm knowledge functional and fresh. Furthermore, being able to implement some of the tricky algorithms from the top of my head on a napkin increases confidence which may sometimes shake under the many stresses of interviews. Finally, being able to implement many algorithms quickly pays off in coding competitions.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the original katas are canonical. My coding katas are certainly not. They evolve and change with time. At some point easier algorithms and data-structures become trivial and it no longer makes sense to practice them. I don&rsquo;t practice writing a stack/queue anymore. Sometimes I realize how similar few algorithms are so I leave one of them out. Many graph problems reduce to DFS. Occasionally I study through new algorithms and add them to katas. For example, I&rsquo;ve recently added SkipList and SuffixArray. I also group algorithms so that each kata is of similar size. At the moment I have <a href="https://github.com/drseergio/practice/tree/master/katas">5 katas in my repertoire</a>. It takes about 30-60 minutes to complete each one. I aim to complete all of the katas once a week &mdash; on average less than one kata per day. I&rsquo;m also timing my practice now to see how long each kata takes.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s a distilled version of the algorithm study plan (~1 month of full-time effort)</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>List algorithms/data-structures you need to learn deeply. When in doubt leave it out. Make it as short as feasible. Can always add more later.</li>
<li>Choose an algorithms text. I recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X">&ldquo;Algorithms, 4th edition&rdquo; by Robert Sedgewick</a>.</li>
<li>Schedule sufficient time each day to read the text and implement algorithms by hand. Keep premature enthusiasm at hand and keep the workload manageable. There&rsquo;s a reason it takes a month.</li>
<li>Collect algorithm implementations and group them into katas.</li>
<li>Regularly perform katas by reimplementing algorithms.</li>
<li>Revise katas, remove trivial algorithms and add new ones as you see fit.</li>
<li>Repeat 6, 7.</li>
</ol>


<p>I&rsquo;d like to believe that this study of algorithms and practice of katas will pay off. It is hard to say, taking into account the many factors that affect a hiring decision. Doing a comprehensive study like this won&rsquo;t guarantee success but doing nothing almost certainly guarantees failure. The study of algorithms is just the first interview preparation step. I&rsquo;ve introduced katas as means to not forget what I&rsquo;ve just learned. But as I&rsquo;ve practiced and grown my personal collection I see myself continuing with katas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Exactly two weeks ago I thought I was exhausted from preparing for job interviews (I will write a separate post explaining my study strategy). After all, I have been averaging 6-8 hours of algorithms and Java study almost every day for 2 months (I am switching careers and going full-time in software engineering). In reality, it was a virus that caused physical break-down, an eye infection and fever. In what can be described as the most spontaneous decision of my life I decided we need to take a short break and go to the sea. How spontaneous? I felt debilitating headache Monday morning and we flew out on Wednesday.</p>

<p>So we chose a destination we could fly to ASAP that had decent weather and warm sea. In the end we went to Crete. I had previously visited Crete 10 years ago. Crete left an impression not only with the warm Mediterranean climate and usual resort-world bells and whistles but also with a natural wonder I couldn&rsquo;t visit at the time. I&rsquo;m talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samari%C3%A1_Gorge">Samaria Gorge</a>. It was time to finally hike it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26720077554"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7444/26720077554_8d954f1239_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>I am amazed at how the local businesses managed to market and sell Samaria Gorge and lull even the most unprepared unfit tourists, making it a must-visit attraction. In the high season, which unsurprisingly is the worst time of the year to visit it, Samaria Gorge attracts 30,000-40,000 tourists per month. Some of those tourists later write horror stories as to how difficult and extreme the whole experience was. Legends get born and rumors get spread.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m here to bust some myths. First of all, it is not the largest Gorge in Europe. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdon_Gorge">Verdon Gorge</a> is. Second, it is not an extremely difficult adventure. It&rsquo;s best described as a hike of medium-easy difficulty. Most of the time the route descends which is admittedly not my favorite (I prefer ascents or mixed terrain). While the terrain is rocky there is nothing extreme about it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26720813773"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7251/26720813773_bb58db0b87_n.jpg" width="213"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27052274170"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7653/27052274170_654d0d72a3_n.jpg" width="213"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27257029391"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7006/27257029391_246c4a35bb_n.jpg" width="213"></a></p>

<p>In terms of gear the hike requires mostly decent shoes. I brought the most minimal and lightweight shoes I own and they were just fine. Apparently the overly successful marketing attracts unsuspecting couch potatoes in flip-flops but I haven&rsquo;t spotted a single person whose clothing stood out as outlandlishly inadequate.</p>

<p>Without any strain we completed the walk in 5:45. We took lots of pictures and made one stop for packed breakfast in the old Samaria village which is in the middle of the route. My watch counted 20Km but I suspect that&rsquo;s due to errors due to poor sky visibility in the gorge. Officially, the total distance from the park entrance to the beach is approximately 17Km. Sounds realistic.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/590696789">View our GPS track on Strava</a></p>

<p>End of May is a fantastic time to visit it because the gorge is full of life: vegetation and flowers. Most importantly, it is not scorching hot. I find that the scenery becomes interesting after the Samaria village, roughly 8-10Km into the hike. The first half is similar to a walk in a park and it&rsquo;s not possible to see much of the gorge. But the actual gorge looks breathtaking.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27230250722"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7349/27230250722_01d870f748_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>In fact, I would consider visiting the park in the opposite direction: arriving by ship at the end of the route in the morning, exploring the gorge area up to the Samaria village and taking the ship back. It&rsquo;s possible to pull this off with a rental car by keeping it in the town from where the ship departs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27257075871"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7001/27257075871_daabee70cf_n.jpg" width="213"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27230278702"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7370/27230278702_2a68bc4ed6_n.jpg" width="213"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27052293150"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7439/27052293150_bf9f47ae31_n.jpg" width="213"></a></p>

<p>Speaking of transportation it&rsquo;s not great. There are only 3 ships per day: 2 in the morning and only one in the afternoon at 17:30. Those who finish reasonably at about 14:00-15:00 are doomed to stay in the area. Admittedly, the area ain&rsquo;t bad and the beach is completely worth a visit. In case somebody doesn&rsquo;t make it to the ship there are plenty of rooms available for rent.</p>

<p>We chose to get to the park and back by taxi. The price is not unreasonable if staying near city of Chania. For us, the higher taxi price was worth extra hours in the morning and in the evening. A tourist bus takes longer because it needs to pick-up tourists from various hotels.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26720065894"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7558/26720065894_49f0bc7d21_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re visiting Crete pack a pair of shoes &mdash; the gorge is worth a visit!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Around Christmas in 2015 I received doctor&rsquo;s diagnosis that my left tibia bone is fractured and that I can&rsquo;t run for the foreseeable future. Of course, I tried against all reason but the persisting pain made me realize it&rsquo;s in my own best interest to let it heal peacefully and not break it completely. Luckily, I discovered that cycling and swimming don&rsquo;t hurt at all. I suppose that&rsquo;s because the load spread is altered and tibia is not as stressed.</p>

<p>I decided not to lose any time and began training straight away. I have setup an indoor training &ldquo;lab&rdquo; and rigorously followed a training routine three times a week. Although I have been an avid cyclist my level of cycling fitness could have been ranked as &ldquo;beginner&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve had plenty of distance under my belt but insufficient endurance to sustain intensive effort necessary in competitive cycling. The training program has slowly come to a successful end and I would like to showcase my setup.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27306868565"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7345/27306868565_5c29150c79_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>I previously found the idea of indoor cycling trainers a boring pasture. However, training indoors has its merits. The biggest advantage I see is the possibility of structured training where the load of every training session is carefully chosen to stimulate improvement in the areas that need it the most. It is very difficult to go for a ride with friends and keep a specific tempo. With an indoor trainer it&rsquo;s possible to define fine-grained intervals with specific intensity. There are training programs for improving overall cycling fitness or, for example, improving climbs or sprints.</p>

<p>Of course, there is also the convenience factor. With an indoor trainer I have no excuse skipping a training session due to bad weather. It&rsquo;s always available and takes no time to get started with it.</p>

<p>But what really attracted me are the so-called smart trainers, like the <a href="http://eu.wahoofitness.com/devices/kickr.html">wahoo Kickr</a> that I purchased. The smart trainers are dynamically controlled by software so the resistance is continuously updated. Smart trainers can simulate changing terrain and most importantly let the user focus on cycling. With the regular &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; trainers the user must adjust resistance manually. I think I would get tired of it very quickly and would definitely cheat by not being timely in amping up the difficulty.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26700511863"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7605/26700511863_2f9435ffaf_n.jpg" width="213"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27236905401"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7352/27236905401_bf09f5907b_n.jpg" width="213"></a></p>

<p>There are various tools for controlling smart trainers. Some run on Android and iOS devices while others require full desktop OSes. Either bluetooth or ANT+ wireless protocols are used to interface with the trainers. I purchased an ANT+ adapter for my computer for the purpose of controlling the smart trainer and also for accessing data from a heart rate band and a power meter sensor on my bike.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27209876762"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7323/27209876762_5bafeb4735.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The &ldquo;killer app&rdquo; for me is surely <a href="http://zwift.com/">Zwift</a>. It&rsquo;s a well-implemented detailed immersive 3D virtual cycling world. Zwift is capable of controling smart trainers and simulating terrain. For all the user cares he is presented with a detailed simulation that brings variety and much needed distraction to otherwise boring workouts. Zwift is a open-world multiplayer game with other cyclists riding along. Zwift integrates nicely with Strava, here is a couple of my own workouts:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/554205363">https://www.strava.com/activities/554205363</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/536343127">https://www.strava.com/activities/536343127</a></p>

<p>Zwift also supports structured training. There are multiple training programs to choose from. It&rsquo;s also possible to create a custom one. I chose a 12-week program aimed at increasing overall cycling fitness and specifically improving the Functional Threshold Power (FTP). With ilnesses, travel and other commitments in place the program actually took me more than 4 months to complete.</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tqf5dD-ofQg "></iframe></div>


<p>I have complemented the setup with a webcam mounted on a tripod and connected to my mobile computer. This allowed to see my posture and make continous corrections. A mirror would work even better but there is no place in my room for one and I already had all the components to make a &ldquo;high-tech mirror&rdquo; solution work.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26699661594"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7311/26699661594_317dc183ac_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>This is how I see myself during a typical workout (videos are not focused very well but the idea should be clear):</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CntF-2F9kGc "></iframe></div>


<p>Speaking of complements I discovered a few additional pieces of technology I consider vital for training and worthy of an immediate purchase. First of all, a bicycle computer or a training watch equipped with GPS and ANT+/Bluetooth interfaces. I went for both, choosing a Garmin 920XT watch and a Garmin Edge 500 cycling computer. These gadgets track workouts and allow the user to see his progress and make corrections. Having these devices is a luxury that had been available only to professional athletes in the past. Basically, it&rsquo;s like having a personal coach watch over your shoulder every moment.</p>

<p>The reason I own both is because a cycling computer is convenient for glancing at many fields at a time, without taking the hand off the handlebar. I use the cycling computer exclusively for viewing data. In fact, I bought it used at a bargain price. I don&rsquo;t cosider fancier products worthwhile.</p>

<p>Finally, a power meter is becoming increasingly popular. I&rsquo;m going so far as to say that a power meter is a complete must, especially if the user is an amateur interested in racing. A power meter basically quantifies the effort the user is currently putting out. It takes guessing out of the training. With a power meter I can adjust my power output and effort during a ride. For example, in a race I could adjust power output depending on the course to avoid overstrain. I could immediately see if the current effort is sustainable or not based on past observations. Smart trainers come with built-in power meters but I&rsquo;ve added a relatively inexpensive <a href="http://stagescycling.com/us/products/">Stages power-meter</a> for upcoming outdoor rides.</p>

<p>With the program almost finished what do I plan to do next? My <a href="/blog/2016/05/27/rigimarsch-2016/">tibia has recovered</a> and I&rsquo;m almost finished with a 4-month swimming training program. I am going to develop a new plan for the next 3-4 months. With the summer here I&rsquo;m definitely going outdoors but I&rsquo;ll combine the outdoor rides with more structured indoor training to hone some of the skills, like climbing. Training ain&rsquo;t easy but I get lots of satisfaction and joy out of it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another year, another <a href="http://rigimarsch.ch/">Rigimarsch</a>! <a href="/blog/2015/05/24/longest-non-stop-hike-in-my-life/">Last year</a> I&rsquo;ve participated in an annual night hike up to the Rigi mountain. It was a tough yet exhilerating experience. This year I&rsquo;ve repeated the challenge together with John.</p>

<p>The route was the same as always: 50 or so kilometers with a 1500m ascent in the last 10 kilometeres. However, the hike felt refreshingly different.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/566448675">View our GPS track on Strava</a></p>

<p>For me personally the hike was a test for the healing Tibia bone that fractured during last year&rsquo;s <a href="/blog/2015/10/31/goals/">half-marathon in Lausanne</a> (I ran 1/3 of the marathon with a fractured bone).</p>

<p>John looks cheerful but everybody is cheerful at the start:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27262027875"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7316/27262027875_338b6e78de_z.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>According to the official information a record 2363 people turned up for the event. Despite the crowd the registration went smoothly. We started walking at around 20:00.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26655251944"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7278/26655251944_ef51583b8c.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27262034825"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7542/27262034825_1b63a4dd46.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The Rigi mountain. It is intimidating to see the peak far ahead throughout the hike:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26656292463"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7482/26656292463_6e22257b37.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27262042505"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7337/27262042505_5bd6972a41.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27262043975"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7659/27262043975_f7ddbf3988.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s Rigimarsch took place on May 4th which is relatively early, compared to previous and future years. The event date is tied to Ascension day. Thanks to the early start there was plenty of snow at the top and the night temperatures were quite cool. I wore every piece of clothing I brought along.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26655268824"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7360/26655268824_c98e764931.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I felt energized and positive even in the last hours of the challenge. This is a huge departure from last year&rsquo;s impression. I still vividly recall just how difficult last few hours were. I think several factors are at play. First, I&rsquo;m in much better physical shape for aerobic activities because I switched from weight lifting to triathlon. Second, we brought trekking poles with us for the ascent. Finally, I came to the hike completely rested and fresh.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/27192498811"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7539/27192498811_04efa1224b.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>John is still smiling at the top, that&rsquo;s the way to do it:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/26655286494"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7711/26655286494_f43a8df2f0.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>Return train from Rigi to Arth-Goldau. There were enough places in the train for everyone to take a seat:</p>

<p><a href="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7443/27164821172_47541b80f6.jpg"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7443/27164821172_47541b80f6.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The hike took us about 12 hours to complete which is almost the same as last year. However, our moving time is a whole hour shorter which means we walked measurably faster but took longer breaks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a complete triathlon newbie I benefit tremendously from the experience and knowledge of others. Just a few little steps save years, if not decades, of trial-and-error, not to mention decrease chances of injuries and increase enjoyment of the sport. My friend Ilya Nedbailo who has successfully completed his first 70.3 Ironman in Rapperswil this year generously shared a couple of tips.</p>

<p>The first of which is getting a professional bike fitting service. I strongly believe that money spent on professional advice is worth much more than any piece of gear one may buy. A lot of human knowledge cannot be easily encoded in articles or books. One really needs one-to-one contact and quick feedback to understand the nuances of physical movement.</p>

<p>Ideally, one should do bike fitting before buying a bike. But almost any existing bike will do just fine. It&rsquo;s not unheard of to see people competing in triathlon on rigid mountain bikes. An existing road bike is certainly sufficient.</p>

<p>Choosing the right professional could be tricky, especially when there are many options. I followed Ilya&rsquo;s recommendation and went to a triathlon-focused sport store <a href="https://www.tempo-sport.ch/">Tempo-Sport AG</a> in Thalwil. I&rsquo;m glad I did because René Kuster is an experienced and dedicated counsellor. As someone who participates in the sport himself he went above the mandatory adjustments and explained what is important in the bike position and why. I find such human experience and knowledge vastly superior to impressive computerized tech. Surely a computerized solution yields correct measurements consistently every time. But who will check your pedaling technique, advise on body posture and check that you are using the right muscles when the fancy system is operated by a disinterested or an inexperienced clerk?</p>

<p>Surprisingly, my bike fits me like a glove. Even the stem length is perfect. We got the handlebar height and saddle position adjusted and then installed clip-on aero-bars. Then René explained me how to pull the pedals and told me to utilize core muscles to stabilize the body. In the subsequent training sessions I could really tell the difference: I kept myself in a good position by engaging core (acknowledged by disappearing wrist pain) and I did the pedal pull movement correctly (acknowledged by feeling muscle pain in a previously unknown area).</p>

<p>René has also suggested an upgrade path when I&rsquo;ll get the itch to spend money on improving my cycling performance. His top 3:</p>

<ol>
<li>road-bike specific pedals and shoes (I&rsquo;m currently using a XC combination of Shimano M780 pedals along with Specialized Rime shoes)</li>
<li>tight aero clothing</li>
<li>deep rim racing carbon wheels</li>
<li>everything else</li>
</ol>


<p>Once I got the bike fitted I built myself a &ldquo;cycling training lab&rdquo; at home which I&rsquo;ll explain in a separate post. For the other two disciplines I&rsquo;m going through a similar phase of collecting advice and early error correction. I&rsquo;ll share more as soon as I learn!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Training for a half-marathon and then successfully finishing one (although not without an injury) hooked me on pursuing further challenges. I haven&rsquo;t run a half-marathon as a way to prove anything. Rather the competition had given me an opportunity to reassure myself that I&rsquo;m capable of carrying out longer undertakings. Ten weeks from zero to finish has been a fantastic learning experience so I am looking forward to the next step which is not only longer but also more challenging. I am committed to successfully finishing a complete Ironman triathlon (IM) race, that is: consecutively swimming 3.86Km, cycling 180.2Km and running 42.2Km while not dying in the process.</p>

<p>Just few months prior as a part of my life-changing course I have given up a lot of pseudo hobbies that I had never really enjoyed. I basically scrapped everything I did and started fresh. I found out that having just one hobby at a time is surprisingly satisfying. I doubt this is a widespread problem. For me, though, too many hobbies not only spread time and attention really thin but also take away joy. I feel happy to accept triathlon as my only hobby and to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to anything else that comes my way. It&rsquo;s cheaper this way, too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen variable amount of craziness across the web and in real life. Some Ironman participants set highly ambitious goals of preparing in shortest time possible. I am not one of them. I want to enjoy the whole process of training and the steady growth, just like I did with running. I had a belief I hate to run. With a little help from patience and discipline I followed a careful plan. And I enjoyed every single run. Not for a moment I thought about the upcoming marathon or what lies ahead. I focused on one and only moment &ndash; the present one.</p>

<p>I intend to piggy-back on the same mindset for IM. A chord of stress has already struck me when I realized that I must rush to prepare myself for the next step: completing a half Ironman next year. As soon as I noticed the fleeting feeling I stopped immediately. I&rsquo;m not going to rush which means I&rsquo;m likely falling out of the 2016 season. I&rsquo;m aiming for an entry into a full IM in 2018. There, I wrote it. I find it REALLY difficult to commit to something so far ahead. But I believe it&rsquo;s going to be yet another fantastic outlet for learning.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile I&rsquo;m going to train and the things get really interesting from here. Unsurprisingly, there is so much information and advice available on the topic that I can&rsquo;t put it in just one entry. So I&rsquo;m going to write semi-regular posts on my training progress and findings. I&rsquo;m completely unfit and unprepared for this challenge right now. I don&rsquo;t even know how to swim properly. But I&rsquo;m excited and looking forward to the long journey ahead!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In September, following a <a href="/blog/2015/09/03/salsa-fargo-rohloff/">Fargo rebuild</a> with s Rohloff Speedhub I have went to ride it in Italy. This time, though, I haven&rsquo;t ridden my bike from A to B. Instead, I cheated and went my wife on a car. The revelation that had followed I have succinctly nicknamed &ldquo;car-a-bike&rdquo;.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/22802670766"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5719/22802670766_f754cb289e.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>In a very concrete sense this is a huge departure from self sufficiency that I strive to achieve. However, it&rsquo;s a fantastic motivation for traveling. Usually I don&rsquo;t like visiting cities that much. I consider most kinds of conventional travel unsatisfying. Yet after a difficult day in the saddle it is a joy to take a hot shower, take a nap on a comfy bed and then proceed for an evening stroll in the area followed by a nice dinner.</p>

<p>The car lets you focus on the most difficult and challenging roads. A cycling tour, however, requires careful planning to ensure the route is not too exhausting. Also, to get to the truly exciting parts one needs to cycle through relatively long stretches of uninspiring roads.</p>

<h2>The full cycling itinerary</h2>

<p>Most of the route planning was undertaken by my wife. There&rsquo;s an excellent resource <a href="http://italy-cycling-guide.info/">Italy Cycling Guide</a> which offers loads of routes and suggestions.</p>

<h3>Day 1 (aka Speedhub in Italy)</h3>

<p>I had zero problems with the bike. Test riding and debugging beforehand helped immensely. The gearing on Speedhub along with a 36t felt sufficient for the steepest climbs.</p>

<p>To fit everything into a rented Volvo V60 station wagon I had to disassemble pretty much everything. Having a bike with Rohloff makes it much easier: there&rsquo;s no derailleur sticking out and there&rsquo;s no cable adjustments necessary.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/22622541430"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/612/22622541430_d5dacd5eac.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/22828655905"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5799/22828655905_91b6e455a9.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> 77.1km, 1630m vertical ascent, <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/390769207">GPS track</a></p>

<p><a href="/images/elba/day1.png"><img src="/images/elba/day1.png" width="120"></a></p>

<h3>Day 2 (aka Riders on the storm)</h3>

<p>Raining cats and dogs for about 2-3 hours. I got completely soaked. Still, getting soaked in summer in Italy is way better than getting soaked along the Rhine river in early spring.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> 86.4km, 1822m vertical ascent, <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/391527939">GPS track</a></p>

<p><a href="/images/elba/day2.png"><img src="/images/elba/day2.png" width="300"></a></p>

<h3>Day 3 (aka The easiest ride in life)</h3>

<p>What was anticipated as another 1800m+ climb day turned out to be a blazing fast descent. The route went from the hills all the way down to the beach. I averaged 26kmh on my Fargo which is a lot more than my usual touring speed of 13-18.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> 67.1km, 26.4kmh average speed (on a Fargo!), <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/392113290">GPS track</a></p>

<p><a href="/images/elba/day3.png"><img src="/images/elba/day3.png" width="300"></a></p>

<h3>Day 4 (aka The best 60km of my life)</h3>

<p>Hills and mountains make cycling challenging and painful but so rewarding and addictive. Though I started cycling up mountain passes less than a year ago I can&rsquo;t get enough of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/22797085762"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5811/22797085762_b3dc567372.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> 59.7km, 1954m vertical ascent, <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/392828417">GPS track</a></p>

<p><a href="/images/elba/day4.png"><img src="/images/elba/day4.png" width="300"></a></p>

<h3>Day 5 (aka The final day of biking)</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/22392234497"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5640/22392234497_9383cf387f.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> 60.6km, 1864m vertical ascent, <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/393913583">GPS track</a></p>

<p><a href="/images/elba/day5.png"><img src="/images/elba/day5.png" width="300"></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to more of these rides.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>&ldquo;<strong>I FUCKING DID IT</strong>&rdquo; keeps resonating in my head as I am crossing the finish line. I can already feel latent excruciating pain (amplified by an adrenaline-fueled last half-mile sprint) slowly setting in. Few minutes later I won&rsquo;t be able to walk but at this glorious energizing moment I feel that my whole life is coming together.</em></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how successfully finishing a half-marathon felt to me.</p>

<p>In addition, I hereby completely reverse my opinion of life goals. I used to believe that goals are a sick abomination propagated by clouded minds of semi-religious self-improvement cults. I had my reasons. For one, I couldn&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s one supposed to do when goals are fulfilled. And most importantly, I couldn&rsquo;t come up with any (&hellip;that I didn&rsquo;t abandon few days/weeks later).</p>

<p>Well, on a sunny day roughly 11 weeks ago I was walking past an advertisement billboard for an upcoming marathon. My mind was clear of stress and worry, thanks to the elapsed three months of sabbatical. Right there, on the spot, I have decided to run it.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m generally fit and sportive I had never run before. Hell, I have always despised running and especially all kinds of competitive events. I used to repeat a cliché: &ldquo;running is wasted time that could otherwise be spent cycling&rdquo;. Successfully finishing a difficult undertaking like that couldn&rsquo;t be achieved in an instant and there was no way to cheat. The instant gratification was out. I knew it was a long path that required disciplined training.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/22025248504"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5699/22025248504_84a4c75689.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>For the next 10 weeks I adopted a simple training program with 4 runs per week (basically, one of the first results in web search). The distances increased progressively until they winded down few weeks before the race. My first training run was 5km long. I could barely finish it. Thoughts were storming through my mind: &ldquo;how am I supposed to run 21km if 5km is already so difficult&rdquo;. That was my first lesson: don&rsquo;t think about the goal and instead focus on the current step. Every time I trained I focused on finishing just that training, nothing else. Miraculously, I haven&rsquo;t given up once and completed every single training run.</p>

<p>Time went by and the d-day approached. While my mind was calm my body was having some doubts. I could feel an increased heart rate during the days leading to the race. The race took place in Lausanne, French part of Switzerland. The vibe at such events is extremely positive and supportive with both, runners and bystanders, cheering for you.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/22025252164"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/765/22025252164_58a0ba4662.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The first two thirds of the race went steady. I maintaned a sustainable pace by regularly double-checking my speed on a sports watch. I followed my breath, movements and hydration. Not much else was going through my mind. It was systematic and joyful. In fact, I smiled a lot.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/22634485092"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5826/22634485092_9b94d001a9.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/22460088480"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/670/22460088480_499343801b.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>On the 14th kilometer something happened to my left leg. I felt pain in the quad muscle area and began to slow down. The pain was so strong I had to change the way I ran to a very inefficient one. While I lost a minute or more on every kilometer I couldn&rsquo;t imagine facing the intense pain for the last 7 or so kilometers. Even with the new foot strike the pain slowly built up and intensified. I realized that if I stop just for a moment it would be the end of the race. Most likely the legs would swell and I wouldn&rsquo;t resume. So I kept on. Inefficient, painful but persistent. As I got closer to the finish line cheering crowds and music electrified me. Despite the pain I ran faster and faster, approaching a sprinting pace. The joy culminated as I crossed the line. The emotional spike came so strongly to me that I wanted to cry.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/22659237311"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/616/22659237311_8dd3c46841.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what exactly happened to my legs. Almost a week later I am still limping but the pain has mostly subsided. I trained carefully and had plenty of long distance runs. I had sufficient nutrition and hydration. I suppose nobody is exempted from risk at such endurance events, even with the best preparation. Once the pain is fully absent I&rsquo;ll surely be back with new goals in mind.</p>

<p>The experience taught a me a couple of invaluable new lessons as well as cemented a few old ones. Like never before, I believe that lessons from sports are relevant to other areas of life.</p>

<p>First, I came to realize that it&rsquo;s important to strive for the difficult and challenging things. It became immediately obvious to me that in the last couple of years I haven&rsquo;t dreamed big enough and settled for things that were easy to imagine. I tended to favor problems for which I already had an idea in my mind. Half-marathon seemed initially impossible to me which made it a clear practical example of what scale of problems to go after. When something seems almost impossible it&rsquo;s worth going after!</p>

<p>Second, as I had already admitted in the opening, I understood the value of setting life goals. It does not matter what kind of goals to choose initially, as long as they are non-trivial. As life generally doesn&rsquo;t have meaning any arbitrary goal might get one going. The success in one area will prepare you for unrelated challenges. Competitive sports offer a great training opportunity.</p>

<p>Third, there&rsquo;s nothing confusing about what to do when goals are complete. In fact, the finite lifespan of goals is very motivating and energizing. Pain and hardship don&rsquo;t last forever. Once you complete the goal it&rsquo;s over. Enjoy the moment and have some rest. Then, choose and go after a new goal!</p>

<p>Finally, when it&rsquo;s too hard to come up with any good meaningful goals it might be a sign that you are purposefully ignoring and supressing your true interests. At least I found myself in such a situation. All the goals I was coming up with ignored my most prominent ambitions and genuine interests. It was hard to face the reality and acknowledge the potential price to pay. That&rsquo;s how comfort zones shrink. It&rsquo;s a slow but sure way to die inside.</p>

<p>Training for and then running a (half)-marathon is potentially a life changing experience but only when the success comes hard and the mind is fertile and open. It didn&rsquo;t come easy to me and I can&rsquo;t appreciate enough everything I have learned and realized.</p>

<p>I am also indebted for the success of my first race to my beloved wife. Without your support and understanding nothing would come out of it. You have a 20% stake in this achievement!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I fell in love with a Salsa Fargo bicycle exactly one year ago. The bike made me newly excited about cycling. No wonder I&rsquo;ve put more than 4000 kilometers on it. I never rode the bike stock and rebuilt it with custom parts as soon as I received it by post (frames were out of stock in July last year).</p>

<p>Following the tour around France I decided to change a few things on the bike to better suit the kind of riding that I do:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>install the original rigid carbon fork instead of a suspended RockShox Reba: I did not feel very confident desceding from mountain passes on windy paved roads even with the lock-out engaged; plus, the original fork has bosses for mounting so-called &ldquo;Anything cages&rdquo; for holding drybags</p></li>
<li><p>remove Cane Creek Thudbuster seatpost: I feel annoyed by the occassional squeaking but it is possible I&rsquo;m going to reinstall it if I notice increased fatigue</p></li>
<li><p>install Rohloff Speedhub 14 IGH: while a derailleur system generally works pretty well internally geared hubs have certain advantages which pique my interest</p></li>
<li><p>change tires: 70-80% of riding I do on this bike are on paved surfaces and gravel, it does not make sense to wear out off-road tires and lose efficiency on the asphalt</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This resulted in the 3rd reincarnation of my favorite bike: Salsa Fargo make 3!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20497054903"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5802/20497054903_7e29d55136.jpg" width="333"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20497047673"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5777/20497047673_f30a77b4cf.jpg" width="333"></a></p>

<p>It is often difficult to understand whether certain parts will work together. I hope this information helps you to (re)build your bike.</p>

<p>I filmed the process of breaking down and re-assembling the bike:</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/u7KHGC5LjJQ "></iframe></div>


<h2>Random pieces of wisdom</h2>

<h3>Chainline</h3>

<p>To achieve a completely straight chainline I&rsquo;m using Shimano XT M780 cranks with a Woolftooth 36t narrow-wide single chain ring. I know Middleburn RS8 X-Type Rohloff crank also works but is way too expensive and ugly for my taste. I couldn&rsquo;t confirm if any other (e.g. ethirteen, truvativ) cranks can be run with the right offset.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20931357759"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/747/20931357759_6128e45f3d_q.jpg" width="150"></a></p>

<h3>Alternator dropout</h3>

<p>Salsa Rohloff alternator dropout works with Rohloff OEM mount. OEM2 plate is not needed. See photo below to understand how the hub/wheel is held in place:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/21108031852"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5798/21108031852_fcaf00487d_q.jpg" width="150"></a></p>

<h3>Rohloff cable routing</h3>

<p>The external Rohloff gear box can be rotated for the best placement. The Fargo frame has cable guides on the seatstays which allow for 3 cables: rear brake and 2 Rohloff cables.</p>

<h3>Rohloff installation</h3>

<p>The installation is simple. Follow the original instructions. Co-motion provides an excellent HOWTO video for their shifter:</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/O3up1eZT3Pg "></iframe></div>


<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to put oil in! The hub is shipped without sufficient oil inside. A tube of oil is included in the package.</p>

<h3>Removing rear wheel</h3>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any information on how hard is to remove the rear wheel when using Rohloff. It is easier than with a derailleur system! First, remove the external gear box. Then, open the quick release axle and slide out the wheel. Done!</p>

<p>When re-installing the wheel put the chain on the rear sprocket and slide the wheel in like on any other bike. No need to break the chain or disengage the drop-outs. It&rsquo;s easier than a derailleur system because it&rsquo;s not necessary to fiddle with the chain to get it on the cassette.</p>

<h3>Mounting E3 tail light on the rear rack</h3>

<p>While the alternator rack does not have holes to install a rear tail light I attached the E3 tail light with a double-sided tape and a couple of plastic zip ties. The cable can be guided along the top tube of the rack.</p>

<h3>Salsa rear rack (non alternator version)</h3>

<p>Non-alternator Salsa rack does NOT fit an alternator-equipped Salsa frame.</p>

<h3>Cockpit housing routing</h3>

<p>It is not trivial to route the brake housing when using Co-Motion drop-bar shifter. It is especially tricky with Supernova handlebar extender. I used a staged approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>leave the stem bolts loose to allow handlebar movement left and right</li>
<li>move Co-Motion shifter onto the bar but don&rsquo;t tighten the bolt yet</li>
<li>install brake levers</li>
<li>install the first part of housing (to the barrel adjusters) and route the right one through Co-Motion shifter</li>
<li>slide the handlebar right and temporarily move Co-Motion shifter as left as possible</li>
<li>tape the right side of the handlebar up to the tapered point of the handlebar</li>
<li>slide Co-Motion shifter to the right; I moved it as far right as the wide diameter of the bar allows it</li>
<li>install Supernova handlebar extender (for mounting the front light on) and route the brake housing through openings</li>
<li>continue as usual</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20495491904"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5816/20495491904_32d8e3b11e_q.jpg" width="150"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20930242178"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5782/20930242178_5a68f88e78_q.jpg" width="150"></a></p>

<h2>First impressions</h2>

<p>The bike came together cleanly. Salsa designed the Fargo frame around possible Rohloff use. The frame has sufficient cable guides and the Rohloff Alternator dropout is easy to install and use. Adjusting chain tension is straightforward. No need for chain half-links or an eccentric bottom bracket.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/21125844901"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/587/21125844901_1e84167b89_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20929989490"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5740/20929989490_1bb98c75c7_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>The drivetrain is quiet. It is slightly unusual that shifting under load does not always work and can sometimes temporarily send the hub in the higher gear. The upside is that shifting works in a complete standstill. It will require some getting used to.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20495479424"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/757/20495479424_e8de8a8285_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>The shifter is not indexed. Everything happens inside the hub. The upside is simplicity and higher reliability. The downside is reduced feedback in the shifter. The shifts are felt but are nowhere crisp as they were on the SRAM Red/X0 combination I had before.</p>

<p>All in all I&rsquo;m satisfied with the result. In fact I&rsquo;m going to put a Rohloff on my second adventure bike which is going to be a so-called 31er/29+ Surly ECR. I came back from the test ride with a huge smile on my face. I just fucking love bikes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Riding vs buying</h2>

<p>I am amused with the nontrivial amount of invented needs by the bicycle industry as well as the strength of its marketing departments. Each year brings new wheel/tire size standards, new drive-train groupsets and mass-produced lifestyles and attitudes. Suddenly, many enthusiasts desperately realize their need for full-suspension fat bikes with a certain kind of axles for &ldquo;backpacking&rdquo; &ldquo;adventure&rdquo; &ldquo;expeditions&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t see how bicycle gear obsession is any different from the common consumerism. In the photography world it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;GAS&rdquo; &ndash; gear acquisition syndrome &ndash; which is known to be unconducive to original work.</p>

<p>I am not immune to the disease either. In fact, I have a very heavy case of it. I&rsquo;m obsessed with bikes and bike parts which doesn&rsquo;t land financial wellbeing a huge favor. But the solution is actually pretty simple: just ride the goddamned bike [you already have]!</p>

<p>When I have had photography GAS at one moment I had owned 4 digital cameras. My photographs were not amazing and most of the gear sat idle. Now I own 1 camera and 2 lenses: 35mm and 55mm. I appreciate the limitations and praise the amazing camera body every time I use it. I&rsquo;m definitely not doing any worse than before. If anything, I feel a bit more creative having just 2 prime lenses. It&rsquo;s the same with bikes. I recently caught another potentially expensive itch to get a new bike. And that meant one thing only: not enough saddle time!</p>

<h2>Putting the cranks where my mouth is</h2>

<p>With my diagnosis unambigously established, me and John decided to go for a cure cycling tour across France.</p>

<p><a href="/images/france-tour.png"><img src="/images/france-tour.png" width="1021"></a></p>

<p>Our actual route traced through the following places: <strong>Dijon</strong> &mdash; <strong>Morvan national park</strong> &mdash; <strong>Nevers</strong> &mdash; <strong>Bourges</strong> &mdash; <strong>Saint-Aignan</strong> &mdash; <strong>Tours</strong> &mdash; <strong>Saumur</strong> &mdash; <strong>Nantes</strong> &mdash; <strong>Noirmoutier</strong> &mdash; <strong>Jard-sur-Mer</strong> &mdash; <strong>La Rochelle</strong>. The route incorporated parts of Eurovelo 6 and Eurovelo 1. We rode for 8 days and totaled approximately 1100 Km. The distances across days were spread the following way: <strong>115</strong> &ndash; <strong>108</strong> &ndash; <strong>170</strong> &ndash; <strong>140</strong> &ndash; <strong>155</strong> &ndash; <strong>166</strong> &ndash; <strong>116</strong> &ndash; <strong>119</strong>. We allowed ourselves 8 days to complete it. However, we bought flexible return tickets and had 2 extra days just in case.</p>

<p>Originally, we were thinking of a much grander 2-3 week tour this year in a northern European country. But I&rsquo;m glad we decided against it because we weren&rsquo;t yet ready for potential adversity.</p>

<h2>Our story</h2>

<p>One early Sunday morning I woke-up at 3:55. I had a nice warm breakfast cooked by my dear and understanding wife. I then drove in a rented car to the train station and from there carried my packed bike and panniers across two train stations before meeting John. We then took a train to Basel where we ran with the ultra-uncomfortable heavy Tranzbags across our shoulders to the French part of the train station. I felt slightly nervous because of the french TGV train. Although SNCF (the French train company) clearly states that packed bikes are allowed on all trains I knew enough of the culture to realize we might still have trouble. Gladly we had zero issues and soon enough we arrived in Dijon and unpacked our bikes. I suppose traveling first class has its merits.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20190464608"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3807/20190464608_e6a225fdb3.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>We bought some snacks at the train station and then some groceries in a Thai shop along the way. We planned our first few days to be the hardest with the most elevation gains. It&rsquo;s better to plan for tough days first while you&rsquo;re still rested and fresh. We learned this the hard way in the last year&rsquo;s Rhine tour. Back then we rode for 30 or so kilometers the first day. And we had to ride until midnight the many days after to compensate for it.</p>

<p>From early on we joined local insignificant roads and cycling paths. We followed beautiful Canal de Bourgogne with its many boats. There were numerous recreational weekend cyclists on the paths close to nearby cities.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/19755784074"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/465/19755784074_decd610c30.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>Once we departed from the canal the scenery abruptly changed into typical rural country-side France: lots and lots of fields and small run-down villages. The scenery reminded me of my home country Latvia. The weather was too perfect to be true: cloudy and around 17C.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20190413600"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/261/20190413600_79cd562045_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>Our first destination was the Morvan national park. As we got closer our path has led us into forests and unpaved roads. Parts of the roads were washed out. Others had huge trees lying across them so we had to lift our bikes. At times we had to walk. Frankly I didn&rsquo;t anticipate we would need to negotiate such terrain but these challenges set the right adventure spirit early on. Our average speed fell quickly and it was hard to imagine we would do the original 130km planned for the day.</p>

<p>I learned that &ldquo;unpaved&rdquo; means different things to Swiss and French. In Switzerland &ldquo;unpaved&rdquo; means a finely packed gravel you can ride with a road bike. In France &ldquo;unpaved&rdquo; may mean a mud bath, a single-track or an alltogether abandoned path last driven on a grandfather&rsquo;s Land Rover 20 years ago.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20384617841"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/317/20384617841_6ee210343b_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>I felt I should have changed my worn tires before this tour but I can only imagine how much worse it was for John who had touring tires without any knobs.</p>

<p>It is amazing how much the scenery changes during the day while cycling. At first the scenery appears to drag on forever. But once the day is over and you look back it&rsquo;s hard to comprehend it all happened in one day. That also presents a challenge for taking photos: nothing seems interesting enough until it&rsquo;s all over. And then you regret not taking enough of shots.</p>

<p>The weather started behaving and we had to wait out a couple of showers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20369920682"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/433/20369920682_26264c1d93.jpg" width="333"></a></p>

<p>At about 18:30 we had to stop cycling because we were soaking wet and shivering from cold. Somehow my original plan of not taking rain-proof gear didn&rsquo;t account for 14C temperature in summer. We were lucky to find a small house and not camp the first night. It would have been a miserable experience. A nearby campsite had a working cafe so we downed a couple of burgers before settling down.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20352235486"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/448/20352235486_f92b3f8c0b.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>In the morning we had to wait out a couple of determined showers despite our ambition to leave early and make the most out of the day. This tour taught me patience as ambition in the wrong circumstances is foolish. We stopped at a local grocery store to stock up on food. After a couple of days shopping for groceries became routine. I learned that restaurants and cafes are far from necessary when it&rsquo;s possible to buy varied and fresh food from the local market.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20192163249"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/298/20192163249_0a62a831cb_m.jpg" width="240"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20192166779"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/554/20192166779_14b5d71f6a_m.jpg" width="240"></a> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/19757883033"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/319/19757883033_f5a418d2e9_m.jpg" width="240"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20190673638"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/385/20190673638_1fb6dcd2b4_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>There were a couple of lakes along the way but the scenery appeared ominous because of the drizzling rain and gray skies. As the unpaved forest roads made their grand reapperance I became quite worried as you can read from my facial expression:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20191863269"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/378/20191863269_a06f4cf6de.jpg" width="333"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20190506138"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/545/20190506138_946012d336.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I felt anger and anxiety because we were crawling and I didn&rsquo;t plan for such extended terrain contingencies. I was counting on fast packed gravel speedways! Eventually, the skies cleared and we returned to the country-side. We made a decision to divert from the original route and stick to secondary asphalt roads to get to our next target.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20378510665"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/520/20378510665_0e62a9bb50.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/19755836414"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/434/19755836414_06bfcb25cb_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>We arrived in a town Nevers and camped in the municipal camp site. We checked the weather forecast in advance to make sure it won&rsquo;t rain or else camping would be a suboptimal choice. It was our first camping night and I was pleasantly surprised it took us only about 20 minutes to set everything up.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20191886119"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/430/20191886119_3efc34e661_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>Sleeping though was an entirely different story. I couldn&rsquo;t fall asleep and felt cold during the night. I was restless and half awake the whole night. I forgot to take ear plugs with me. At least I&rsquo;m glad we had decided to purchase summer sleeping bags. Our original plan was to use silk liners.</p>

<p>We woke up early at 5:20 to make the most of the day as we had seen the forecast predicting rain after 18:00. Something kept me going but sleep deprivation felt miserable. This can be judged by the amount of photos taken during the day: very few.</p>

<p>As we got to a big city Bourges by lunch time we couldn&rsquo;t find a working cycling store because everyone one of the four stores was prematurely closed for a lunch break. John forgot his helmet in the train and needed to get a new one. In the next two hours we purchased groceries and went to a posh burger place. Once we bought a helmet we made a decision to continue for an extra 80 kilometers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/19755853054"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/356/19755853054_8683722906_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>Our progress seemed very slow. The roads were winding up and down slightly and we were going against the wind. In addition, we had taken a somewhat busy road with lots of truck traffic.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/20190478720"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/281/20190478720_4a234e170f_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p>At about 17:00 it predictably started to rain. My spirits were really low because I knew the forecast. We refused to stay in Bourges because that would end the day too early. There were no places to stop between Bourges and our next target. It is a persistent challenge to find accommodation at the right time.</p>

<p>We had to continue despite the rain. The rain wouldn&rsquo;t go away. So we climbed our bikes, wore the wind-proof jackets and pushed on. We soon realized it wasn&rsquo;t so bad. The wind has subsided and the road radiated heat. We were wet but not cold. Our bodies eventually dried our clothes.</p>

<p>Few hours into the ride we called a couple of hotels to book a room so that we have a place to stay when we get to the town late in the evening. At 130-140 kilometer mark we felt energized. I realized it is a very common occurrence. The first 70-100 or so kilometers are the hardest. The first 70 are, in fact, torturous because progress appears too slow.</p>

<p>Admittedly, up to this point I felt similar to how we felt in our previous Rhine tour. Anxious and nervous we&rsquo;re not making enough progress among unexpected difficulties. The tables turned the next day when I felt, for the first time, confidence and freedom from the shackles of our original plan. Our goal is to enjoy the journey and we can alter and change the route in any way we like.</p>

<p>On the following days we got on to route EuroVelo 6 and from there traced the longest French river La Loire. To take the shortest path we used Google Maps directions and a micro SD slot on my phone to create a GPX track that can be swallowed by Garmin.</p>

<p>The scenery offered views on splendid bridges over La Loire and its many castles.</p>

<p>The larger French cities, such as Bourges or Nantes appeared surprisingly industrial.</p>

<p>We got into a habit of arriving somewhat late to the campsites. Most of the receptions close at 18:00. We basically had to trespass, find empty pitch spots and then pay in the morning upon departure. This made the staff quite confused. But finishing our days at 18:00 or so seemed too early. As we didn&rsquo;t cook dinner there wasn&rsquo;t much to do. Why stay bored in the campsite when we can be enjoying the road?</p>

<p>We caught up with the planned schedule in Nantes. But once we have got there we decided to take a train to La Rochelle to make the last few days easier. I am so glad that the morning train was full and we decided against it! Instead, we continued EuroVelo 6 route to the coast of the Atlantic ocean and then continued South through EuroVelo 1. The road along the ocean has quickly overshadowed everything we cycled so far. To make the last few days easier we decided to take a train from La Rochelle to Bordeaux thinking that we&rsquo;ve seen enough of French country side roads.</p>

<p>Pine trees, the smell of open water and white sand reminded me of my home country once more: it was like a bigger and better version of Jurmala. Our first day along the coast stretched late into the evening because we have run into a few problems. Namely, the road to an island we hoped to take was flooded that time of the day, we have ridden into a dead end trying to take another road and we lost each other. The reward was one of the most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen.</p>

<p>Camping (unathorized, as usual) on the Noirmoutier island was fantastic. In the morning I discovered a flat rear tire which was promptly fixed:</p>

<p>We continued along the coast until we reached La Rochelle. There were a few resort towns along the way which made me panic. I don&rsquo;t like crowded places. We breezed through them quickly. On the weekend cycling paths were crawling with beachgoers. Cycling in the early hours of the day was much better. There are also annoying obstacles, such as gates, to slow the cyclists down.</p>

<p>Once we arrived in La Rochelle we cycled across an enormous bridge to the Isle of Rhé and bathed in the ocean.</p>
