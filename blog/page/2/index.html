  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finding good sources of information is similar to finding a good diet &mdash; there is an overwhelming amount of stuff available (abundance of calories) but the utility (healthiness) of it is close to zero. Many news outlets and online media have incentives that are in conflict with providing thoughtful quality material. Media chases advertisements. In the race to achieve highest numbers of visits and ad impressions it shamelessly bombards us readers with juicy junk articles with loud headlines that shamelessly grab our attention. These articles give a quick gratification but in the long-term rob us of thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see an immediate solution that works for the whole society. However, that does not preclude me from avoiding the poison altogether. I intentionally avoid mainstream news. I don&rsquo;t get sucked into politics and my perception of the world is not skewed by the over representation of certain topics (such as airplane crashes). I don&rsquo;t blindly follow industry news either. There are lots of new tools, frameworks and gadgets coming out every day. It&rsquo;s impossible to learn everything so I prefer to focus on lasting ideas and skills. I can pick-up and learn ephemeral details whenever I have a specific task at hand.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t passively follow what is currently trending or popular. Instead, I actively seeks news through a curated list of blogs and news sources. Even with a curated list I had problems getting overwhelmed with too many items. A low signal to noise ratio takes a lot of effort to deal with.</p>

<p>From now on I will maintain an updated list of RSS feeds of blogs and websites that I am subscribed to on the <a href="/news-sources">News sources</a> page.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a habit of regularly reading books that are of pseudo spiritual and self help and personal growth nature. I did not follow their contents word for word but I believed I could glean useful solutions to life problems and new ways to think about reality. Recently, I came to a conclusion that I&rsquo;m not going to read such books anymore. No more productivity books. No more books on settings goals. No more books on personal growth.</p>

<p>At the core of my discontent is a realization that every person exists within a unique set of circumstances. The set of circumstances benefits from a matching set of solutions. Solutions could be anything from spiritual beliefs and value systems to productivity habits and strategies. Whenever a person observes himself succeeding in light of his actions he entrenches in conviction that his discoveries are universal.</p>

<p>I have a problem with this premise. Even in relatively similar environments every person is shaped by an intersection of local influences, actions, ideas, challenges and opportunities. I don&rsquo;t believe there are universal truths as to how to run distinctive lives. Trying to blindly follow someone else&rsquo;s beliefs is akin to dull imitation. In addition, the result is likely to be irrelevant and misplaced.</p>

<p>Most of the self help literature builds upon anecdotes &mdash; stories of highly successful people (I&rsquo;m talking about success in its widest meaning, anything between spiritual enlightenment and lucrative business empire). Authors conveniently escape talking about failures and millions of interrelated things that contribute to extraordinary outcomes. I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s possible to extract specific traits or behaviors that guarantee success. Some highly successful people are punctual. Others never gave shit about being organized yet are arguably in the same success &ldquo;league&rdquo;.</p>

<p>After all the hours spent on reading these books I&rsquo;ve embraced introspection as an alternative tool. Instead of looking outwards to find solutions I look into myself to understand what challenges I face, what is important, what brings happiness and joy. I also take a moment to appreciate what I already have.</p>

<p>See what I have done here? Exactly what the self help literature does. I&rsquo;ve imposed personal experience to provide seemingly helpful guidance. The problem is that this &ldquo;guidance&rdquo; builds upon my perception and a set of beliefs that are likely to be very different from yours. Maybe if I&rsquo;ve never read any of the self help books my stance would be different. Perhaps you should read all the self help books you can and come to the same conclusion independently.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s anything to take away then it&rsquo;s that it helps to be critical when reading other people&rsquo;s ideas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been sick in and out with all kinds of cold during past several weeks. I had a lucky break last weekend and went for a snowshoe hike in Arosa, Switzerland.</p>

<p>It has been the first time I&rsquo;ve taken the snowshoes on. I had a misconception that snowshoes will let you float on the surface. They won&rsquo;t. After a couple of hours I got a hang of it and could even run. I know I&rsquo;ll be spending time outdoors so I splurged on luxurious MSR ascent snowshoes. These snowshoes have good grip &ndash; I could not slide even if I wanted to.</p>

<p>The hike itself has been rather easy and there was not much snow. However, it has been a good opportunity to get used to the snowshoes.</p>

<p>We have spent the day bathing in sun above a fog that covered most of central Switzerland. On our way back there was a 2 minute opportunity to shoot the fog and the sunset before descending back into fog&rsquo;s vast but short-lived kingdom (we were changing train to bus as the regular train route was blocked by a rockfall).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Via ferratas come in different difficulty levels. Last week I&rsquo;ve done a K2 climb. Yesterday I went to Fuerenalp along with two friends and did a K4 climb. The route is a lot more exciting. Wet and slippery stones and supports presented an additional challenge.</p>

<p>According the alpine log book there were no other climbers that day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had inspiration to work on something creative today. I have decided to experiment with pseudo black back-drop shots. The idea is to setup a camera so that it picks-up light from the flash only. I have produced a video and a couple of photographs. See below!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Investments are a cornerstone for building passive income, increasing wealth and eventually reaching financial independence. I have passion for learning how the investment world functions and what are the different trading strategies. For the past 4 years I have mostly relied on low-cost index investments and company stock in distressed industries. In addition, I have had lots of interest towards quantitative strategies.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago I have faced a possibility of a major change in life so I have liquidated every investment into cash in preparation for it. The change never came. After reflecting upon my limited trading experience I have realized that I don&rsquo;t have a coherent strategy and I am likely to fall for the many biases and traps, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Confirmation bias. Unless I&rsquo;m doing trading (real or on paper) my brain is likely to pick-up just the positive examples of an investment strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>No single coherent idea or strategy. I have been fascinated by many tools, strategies and approaches. I have spent many hours translating ideas or systems in code that I can run to verify results. When I am chasing so many options I never arrive at anything satisfying and conclusive.</p></li>
<li><p>Not believing into one&rsquo;s own approach. Somewhat related to the previous point. Unless I&rsquo;m confident in a chosen strategy I am likely not to invest timely. This means I miss many gains and lose more often because I pull out prematurely.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of free quality market data. Together with a friend I have written a convoluted system to buy and sell company stock around major price shocks. The system demonstrated fantastic results. However, I have realized that the price data does not include companies that went bankrupt. Such omissions make back-testing overly optimistic.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of desire to dedicate lots of time. I won&rsquo;t last forever and I want to use the opportunity to live my life fully. There is unlimited amount of market information to understand and make use of. Onwards, I consciously choose not to spend all my spare time on investments.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Investment strategy of choice</h3>

<p>To overcome the concerns I have made a decision to consistently follow a strategy that I accept consciously and intellectually. The strategy is called &ldquo;Ivy Portfolio&rdquo;. There are several variations of this strategy and it boils down to holding about 5 diversified instruments when their prices are above a certain threshold. I recommend reading resources I&rsquo;ve linked to at the bottom of this post.</p>

<p>What appeals to me in this strategy is its simplicity and ability to reduce draw-downs in down markets. I will allocate 80% of my portfolio in Ivy Portfolio. The rest is going to be invested in individual companies and experimental quantitative strategies.</p>

<p>Once a month I will spend about 2-6 hours on maintaining my investment portfolio and sharing findings on this site. I will calculate and update signals for the past month, aggregate quarterly performance figures, test alternative strategies and publish results. I consciously impose a limit so that I don&rsquo;t end-up aimlessly procrastinating. I will need to set clear goals and boundaries if I want to fit in the limits.</p>

<h3>Strategy details</h3>

<p>There are several variations of the Ivy Portfolio strategy. The one that appeals to me is called &ldquo;TOP 3 GTAA 13&rdquo;. First, one needs to choose 13 instruments that represent different kinds of assets. I have made a choice of the following instruments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>VTV</strong> &ndash; Vanguard Value ETF (US Large Cap Value)</li>
<li><strong>MTUM</strong> &ndash; iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor (US Large Cap Momentum)</li>
<li><strong>VBR</strong> &ndash; Vanguard Small Cap Value ETF (US Small Cap Value)</li>
<li><strong>VBK</strong> &ndash; Vanguard Small Cap Growth ETF (US Small Cap Momentum)</li>
<li><strong>VEA</strong> &ndash; Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (Foreign Developed)</li>
<li><strong>VWO</strong> &ndash; Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (Foreign Emerging)</li>
<li><strong>VGIT</strong> &ndash; Vanguard Interm-Tm Govt Bd Idx ETF (US 10 Year Government Bonds)</li>
<li><strong>IGOV</strong> &ndash; iShares International Treasury Bond (Foreign 10 Year Government Bonds)</li>
<li><strong>VCIT</strong> &ndash; Vanguard Interm-Tm Corp Bd Idx ETF (US Corporate Bonds)</li>
<li><strong>VGLT</strong> &ndash; Vanguard Long-Term Govt Bd Idx ETF (US 30 Year Government Bonds)</li>
<li><strong>GSG</strong> &ndash; iShares S&amp;P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust (Commodities)</li>
<li><strong>IAU</strong> &ndash; iShares Gold Trust (Gold)</li>
<li><strong>VNQ</strong> &ndash; Vanguard REIT Index ETF (NAREIT Index)</li>
</ul>


<p>The goal is to find representative ETFs with lowest expenses and higher liquidity. On the last trading day of a month performance of each instrument is compared. 3 best performing instruments are bought. The cycle is repeated every month. Portfolio is rebalanced to maintain correct ratios.</p>

<p>It does not matter what tool you use to calculate the results. I prefer R so I have written few functions to do the calculation for me. I present the code below. I assume you have R installed along with the &ldquo;quantmod&rdquo; package. By default, quantmod relies on Yahoo! Finance as the source for price data.</p>

<p>* Instruments that have insufficient data are penalized with large negative returns.</p>

<p>** Ideally the analysis must be performed at the close of the last trading day of the month, however, due to personal reasons this won&rsquo;t be possible every month. This is also why I do it today, rather than on 2013-10-31.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am fascinated with photography. A picture inspires, tells a story, expresses an author&rsquo;s view, captures a fleeting moment, gives an aesthetic pleasure. But there&rsquo;s a way to kill inspiration and make this art forever painful for oneself.</p>

<p>Ever since I&rsquo;ve purchased my own digital camera 4 years ago I&rsquo;ve been both blessed and burdened by photography. I have even purposefully abstained from taking any pictures for at least a couple of lengthy periods. Recently I had breakthroughs that have completely changed my attitude and brought the fun back!</p>

<p>At the root of most of my photography problems was an internal conflict between two seemingly contradicting ideas: &ldquo;enjoy the moment&rdquo; or &ldquo;take a photograph&rdquo;. One part of me badly wanted to take the camera out and put it on a tripod to take a shot. The other part was thoroughly disgusted at the sight of tourists pushing each other just to take an unremarkable shot of themselves. This other part of me reminded me not to become a mindless photo zombie machine. It&rsquo;s a common sight to see anxious visitors snap a landmark and then almost immediately move on to something else. I have seen the culmination at the Louvre museum in Paris where dozens of people are trying to take a picture of Mona Lisa. It&rsquo;s ridiculous. Why go to places at all if you don&rsquo;t genuinely marvel at things? That&rsquo;s why I often prefer to stop and really &ldquo;taste&rdquo; a sight.</p>

<p>Getting a sense of satisfaction from a photograph goes a long way. Realistically, nobody cares about my photos. There are just too many great and amazing photographers out there. Without full-time dedication it is not <em>likely</em> that anyone will become a true artist. I don&rsquo;t aspire to become one. I do photographs as a hobby and I seek satisfaction from my work regardless of how many people will ever see my photographs. But even with a very limited audience presentation is important. Everyone occasionally makes amazing photographs but the problem is that those pictures get mixed with the rest and lose their charm. For example, after a journey I end-up with 3 truly amazing shots and 40 good shots (lets say out of 500 total). It&rsquo;s better to separate pictures in sets and present amazing shots individually.</p>

<p>Then there is the feeling of being overwhelmed with options. There are unlimited number of things you can do to a photograph, not even counting limitless possibilities of composition and exposure. You can retouch a portrait, merge multiple photos together, apply various post processing effects and adjustments. Not surprisingly, this sea of options caused me almost an infinite hesitation. Should make a black-and-white picture? Or duo-tone? Or use crazy colors?</p>

<p>The problem with too many options goes beyond software. Hardware. I own two cameras, three lenses and an assortment of accessories (such as tripods, filters, etc). Carrying too much stuff gave me (head)ache for two reasons: hard to decide what lens/setup to use right now and the practical inconvenience of lugging too much stuff around. That&rsquo;s why now I mostly use a mirrorless camera with a fixed lens. For every occasion I now think ahead of what kind of shots I am after. Limits are good for fueling creativity.</p>

<p>The advent of digital cameras meant that nobody was bound by the limit of 36 frames anymore. The down-side is the actual upside. Instead of having 36 or so pictures one can easily end-up with thousands. It is a chore to go through all these pictures. Even worse, without a usable storage scheme/structure it is virtually impossible to navigate through one&rsquo;s own photos. I went through 3 iterations before I arrived at a system that works reasonably well. I&rsquo;ll explain it in a separate post.</p>

<p>Finally, it is the time pressure that exacerbates everything I have mentioned above. Going to an event or a trip with other people means that others expect to see pictures. Of course it&rsquo;s possible to ignore them and not touch the pictures for more than a year. I&rsquo;ve done that so many times! Obviously, postponing means that the backlog of pictures will grow to thousands (if not tens of thousands) of pictures. At some point there is a mounting pressure to get over the past photos before touching anything recent. It&rsquo;s a down-spiral from here. Why take pictures if I have not touched any from the past year?</p>

<p>The breakthrough that has helped me overcome problems is simple. I&rsquo;ve asked myself what kind of pictures I am taking and why. Depending on the answer I plan accordingly. I keep two major categories in my mind: photos for reporting and photos for pleasure.</p>

<p>The reporting pictures ideally take little to none processing and are mostly for documenting journeys and moments. Rules of good composition still apply but I would not plan on doing black-on-white shots or time-consuming post-processing effects. I keep these photographs as simple as possible. This allows me to share pictures most people care about quickly.</p>

<p>The other kind of photos is for joyous purposes. That includes interesting shooting angles, time-lapses, stitched panoramas, HDR shots and all kinds of fancy processing in software.</p>

<p>The important part is to separate photos into these categories as soon as possible. Then there is no pressure to finish everything at once. I find that having a separate backlog for artistic photos motivating. I return to individual photos and spend time experimenting without pressure. I feel a lot more creative and liberated that way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This Saturday I had a pleasure to do my first &ldquo;via ferrata&rdquo; climb in Switzerland, in Pinut to be precise. Via ferrata routes do not require climbing experience. The idea is to climb up a mountain and various obstacles while being hooked-up to a metal cable that runs along the whole route. Equipment-wise prospective climbers need a harness, a via ferrata set (a Y-shaped lanyard with an energy absorber) and a helmet.</p>

<p>The weather was phenomenally good for late October. Air temperature has risen to almost 20C! Possibly, this has been the last day of the year in Switzerland to do such a climb. I&rsquo;ll be happy to do more via ferrata climbs next year &ndash; there are hundreds of routes throughout the country.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I honestly would not anticipate writing about Microsoft Windows. Not after I have irrevocably and irreversibly switched to Linux and OSX years ago when I was studying at the university.</p>

<p>But here I am, happily typing this in Sublime2 editor on my desktop computer running nothing else but Microsoft Windows 8. Yes, the same computer that had been running Gentoo Linux a week or so ago!</p>

  <h1>More</h1>
  <p>When I&#8217;m not too irritated with tourists I take photos and post them to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68217075@N08/">flickr.com</a>. Sometimes, someone even takes a picture of me!</p>
  <p>On rare occasions I produce videos and publish them under my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/koshukeman/videos">YouTube profile</a>.</p>
  <p>You can find out what I&#8217;m reading by following my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5111037-sergey">Goodreads profile</a>.</p>
