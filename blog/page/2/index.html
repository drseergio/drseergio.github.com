  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of weeks ago I have deactivated my Facebook account. I&rsquo;ve been intending to do that for months. Finally, I&rsquo;ve left the service for good.</p>

<p>Looking all the way back to 2006 I don&rsquo;t have much to show for it. You can&rsquo;t call me an addict because I&rsquo;ve never been hooked as much as people around me. Nevertheless, whenever I had cared to open Facebook&rsquo;s trendy blue interface I have been bombarded with meaningless status updates and viral junk. Numerous pointless apps and games just intensified the noise.</p>

<p>The noise itself never bothered me that much. What really bothered me is the dismal quality of what users share. It&rsquo;s seems to be a common problem with all social media. Most users simply don&rsquo;t share anything worth anyone else&rsquo;s attention. Instead of sharing genuine experiences, reflecting on one&rsquo;s life or authoring insightful writing I&rsquo;ve seen boasting, junk videos, cynicism, meaningless quotes and cryptic posts. Combined, these make their authors feel special and invite pointless discussions.</p>

<p>Facebook always made me feel bad about myself or my life. Other people&rsquo;s experiences seem just so much more authentic and full of life. It&rsquo;s basically like trashy advertising that shows you happy folks cleaning toilets with a certain kind of solvent. But instead of random folks you see whoever you had added to your Facebook &ldquo;friends&rdquo; and instead of cleaning toilets you see them doing whatever is that they were doing.</p>

<p>There are ways to read the &ldquo;stream&rdquo; without feeling insecure and unsatisfied. But it&rsquo;s hard mental and spiritual work. Despite spending considerable time to embrace mindful and present living I find Facebook to be a tough opponent. Facebook pierces through peace like a full metal jacket bullet. It&rsquo;s better to let go and give it up altogether.</p>

<p>Generally, I like the premise of a social network like Facebook. In theory it could be great. Imagine having a close circle of people who exert an effort to distill and publish their thoughts. Imagine a circle of friends who take the time to break down their adventures and experiences into stories. I am in total awe when a person cares to think and write down her thoughts instead of just slapping a bunch of photos in my face. Even if a story is not very coherent or deep.</p>

<p>I understand why Facebook, or any social media for that matter, is like that. It&rsquo;s easier to write and share junk. It&rsquo;s our brains wired for infinite satisfaction. A collection of juicy and emotional posts trigger our long-forgotten instincts just like an unhealthy sugary/fatty meal does. Nobody voluntarily wants to spend time writing or reading long posts when a &ldquo;Wall&rdquo; is bursting with sugar-high gossip, funny and disgusting media. One must willingly overcome animal desires and instincts. Choose a high-value diet &ndash; provoking and challenging information sources.</p>

<p>Not to seem like a hypocrite but I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve shared much in a meaningful way myself. I have not shared much at all. I intend to change with this personal home page. It&rsquo;s far from being a first blog of mine &ndash; there were many before it. For me the hardest part in keeping a personal page is finding a meaningful reason to share. It&rsquo;s all to easy to make a blog nothing else but a collection of the same crappy posts you see in social networks. The reason I think it&rsquo;s different this time is I feel no rush. I enjoy reflecting and writing down thoughts. I truly don&rsquo;t care if there is no value in these musings. I truly enjoy doing it right now.</p>

<p>Hopefully, by some serendipitous encounter you will find this site and share either thoughts or values or hobbies with me. Although even less likely, I hope we meet and do something fun together!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s 1:35am right now and something really bad has happened about 4 hours ago. First, Time Machine on my Mac Mini complained that the backup network disk became inaccessible. Then network shares have stopped responding on all computers. This means something wrong has happened with the wonderful reliable NAS server that I had built weeks ago.</p>

<p>First, I connect to the server via SSH and start poking around. Once I notice that file-system commands, such as <code>ls</code>, cause sessions to hang I become worrisome. I do a reboot hoping that solves the problem. 10 minutes pass. The server does not start.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/images/app-engine.png"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a simple hobby project. The goal is to build an Android application which, as it turns out, requires a backend. The most important task of the backend is to perform certain things at specified times in future.</p>

<p>In this post I will explain how I&rsquo;ve designed a simple scheduler which relies on AppEngine cron, tasks and the datastore. We will make a new trivial AppEngine application that ties everything together. Although I normally prefer Python but I&rsquo;ve chosen Java for this project. I guess that&rsquo;s because I wanted some consistency with the Android counter-part that I&rsquo;m also developing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you follow what I write here and on <a href="http://grow-slowly.com">http://grow-slowly.com</a> you will notice that I am somewhat obsessed with reducing the number of possessions in my life. This directly contradicts another, though negative, characteristic of mine &ndash; to get more gadgets and possessions.</p>

<p>Recently, I have had a lot of good progress on challenging the negative trait. Not only I&rsquo;ve been more successful on overcoming the purchasing obsession but I&rsquo;ve also found ways to enjoy more and get creative at reusing what I already have.</p>

<p>One of my recent projects was to combine several devices into one. I&rsquo;ve got rid of Sony Playstation 3 and merged 2 computers together. Here&rsquo;s the end-result:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I came up with an idea for a mobile application. To be honest, it&rsquo;s more of an excuse to try my hand at writing Android applications and do something new. Since I had almost zero experience with Android I have started by reading the official Google guides and then doing some napkin grade designs of the application architecture.</p>

<p>Immediately I have realized that app requires a back-end as some of the things cannot be reliably performed on the handset itself. Lurking around I have learned about Google Cloud Endpoints lets you create a REST API that clients (be that iOS, Android or JavaScript) can access. Furthermore, my application needs to know who is talking to the back-end so authentication is a hard requirement.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/endpoints/endpoints.png"></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you but personally my productivity is high only when I have a reliable development environment that provides immediate feedback. My first goal then was to create a local environment where I could prototype with Google APIs piece by piece and proceed with building the actual app.</p>

<p>It turned that there are many official pages and guides talking about Google Endpoints and the integration with Android. There is even a 1-click solution called the Mobile Backend Starter. My problem with such solutions is that I don&rsquo;t get a feel for what is being done for me so I prefer to start with the smallest amount of code possible and incrementally build on top of it.</p>

<p>In this article I will guide you through creating a trivial Android application that talks to a back-end powered by Google Cloud Endpoints. Ultimately, the back-end would run on AppEngine but my immediate goal is to provide you with a reliable local development environment where you could try things out. To sum up here are our goals:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>create a dev environment for writing and exploring Android apps that talk to Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) back-end</p></li>
<li><p>use OAuth to authenticate the app to the back-end</p></li>
<li><p>create a simple Android app that demonstrates Android app talking to the GCE back-end and using OAuth to authenticate against the back-end</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I assume you are comfortable with Java but have not done much Android programming and are not familiar with any of the Google cloud products. I assume you are a quick learner and will look things up when something isn&rsquo;t clear. I also assume you&rsquo;re running Linux. I believe instructions are the same for OSX but have no idea about Windows.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have always fancied the idea of having a dedicated storage system to keep personal data and backups. For the last 3 years I have been happily using an off-the-shelf solution &ndash; acer easyStore H340.</p>

<p><a href="/images/freenas/acer.jpg"><img class="right" src="/images/freenas/acer.jpg" width="200"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/Acer-easyStore-H340-2TB_Peripheral_review">Acer H340</a> has 4 hot-swappable SATA slots, occupies little space and looks well. The on-board Atom N230 CPU is not powerful but has low TDP (4W). I have replaced the stock fan with a quieter one and the stock PSU with a passive one to make the server quieter.</p>

<p>In terms of software I had installed gentoo Linux with tons of different packages: file-sharing through NFS/CIFS, DNS server, OpenVPN, Bittorrent sync, transmission-web, BackupPC, various proxies and even Pandora ripper! I&rsquo;ve run a RAID5 on 3 disks using mdadm and used the 4th drive for backups.</p>

<p>But recently I&rsquo;ve decided to switch to a custom-built solution:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Material things break all the time &ndash; one slightly wrong move and your beloved possession is cracked, damaged or shattered. My camera is no exception. Another SLR has slipped from a hand of my friend and landed on the corner of the preview screen of my Canon 500D causing an ugly crack:</p>

<p><img src="/images/canonrepair/01.jpg"></p>

<p>Many folks like to buy new things whenever old ones break or pay a lot for repair. I prefer to fix as much as I can myself. It&rsquo;s fun and very much in-line with the growing stoic inside of me.</p>

<p>Is it possible to fix this problem yourself?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About two years ago I had very little experience in programming in Python. I&rsquo;ve heard of Django and felt excited how flexible it is and how complicated web applications can be elegantly written.</p>

<p>Tracking expenses has always been important for me. At the time I&rsquo;ve relied on KMyMoney program. Frankly, I did not (and still don&rsquo;t) like any such programs. They&rsquo;re either clunky and look like Windows 95 or too complicated or too inefficient. I&rsquo;ve decided to write my own web application in Python using the Django framework.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the previous post I have introduced <strong>photofs</strong> &ndash; a tool I have written for myself that universally solves my photo management problems.</p>

<p>With <strong>photofs</strong> I can easily locate photos by albums, tags, dates. But how would I add the tags in the first place? I use Adobe Lightroom and absolutely love it! I don&rsquo;t use it to manage photos. Lightroom is a gateway from the camera to my collection. Once I&rsquo;m done processing photos Lightroom kisses them goodbye.</p>

  <p>On rare occasions I produce videos and publish them under my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/koshukeman/videos">YouTube profile</a>.</p>
