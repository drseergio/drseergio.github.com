  <div class="entry-content"><p>Weather conditions in Mont Blanc, France, has been favorable this week. So we spontaneously decided to visit it. On a last year&rsquo;s visit we were unlucky as the region was covered in clouds and it was raining so we couldn&rsquo;t see a thing nor go for a walk.</p>

<p><a href="/images/mini-rescue.jpg"><img src="/images/mini-rescue.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>On the way to Mont Blanc we experienced what it feels like to have a car tire burst while going at highway speeds. Nothing exciting or dangerous. Our rental car did not have a spare wheel and the tire was torn to shreds so we had to call evacuation. All in all, only 1.5 hours lost on the incident.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Flumserberg is a popular ski destination because it is close to Zürich. But it&rsquo;s also beautiful in summer. I&rsquo;ve visited Flumserberg last Sunday for an easy downhill walk.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s popular with paragliders:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After gruesome 27+ hours of cycling I feel elated to announce that I have successfully completed the challenge! I have cycled non-stop for 420.8 kilometers, climbing 4953 metres worth of hills and obstacles along the way. The ride has been the greatest physical challenge I&rsquo;ve done in my life. <a href="/blog/2015/05/24/longest-non-stop-hike-in-my-life/">The longest non-stop hike goes to 2nd place now</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a short summary of the ride:</p>

<p><a href="/images/400km_ride.png"><img src="/images/400km_ride.png" width="500"></a></p>

<p><em>Total distance</em>: 420.8km</p>

<p><em>Total vertical ascent</em>: 4953m</p>

<p><em>Difficulty</em>: <strong>extreme</strong></p>

<h2>Planning and preparation</h2>

<p>The idea to set a new personal cycling distance record came to me rather unexpectedly while me and my wife were visiting Rodos last week. You see, relaxing beach vacations are not my thing. I suppose a 400km ride is a complementary yan for the beach vacation yin.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t obsessed over planning the route. I consulted the Swiss national cycling network and picked the easiest (in terms of elevation changes) one that was long enough. I decided on route number 9. Since the route was 100 kilometers too long I left out the first two sections.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.veloland.ch/de/routen/route-09.html">Route 9</a></p>

<p>I studied the map and the elevation chart. I have split the whole route in three major sections to make it digestible to my fragile and wimpy mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>the hardest 170 kilometers, involving a fair amount of climbs at night</li>
<li>medium-difficulty 80 kilometers, mostly already familiar to me</li>
<li>the easiest and flattest remaining 170 kilometers</li>
</ol>


<p>A long ride requires sufficient nutrition. Strava has estimated that I have burned 16k calories. Insufficient hydration and nutrition guarantee failure and muscle cramps. Prior to departure I stuffed two large meals into myself. I also purchased plenty of sport bars and drink mixes. In addition, I carried few fruits and sausages:
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/18547057214"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/395/18547057214_e599a9e733_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>Finally, I asked for live support from my friends. You offered priceless cheering. Without your support I would have given up!</p>

<h2>Transit</h2>

<p>Getting to the starting point took me almost 4 hours, 3 trains and a bus. I had to leave home at about 18:15 to get to Gstaad at 22:30. I started the ride at night to tackle climbs while I was still fresh and unencumbered with sleep deprivation. I wish I could have slept more before the ride but the excitement prevented me from dozing off.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/18981916410"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/440/18981916410_f34a47793b_z.jpg" width="427"></a></p>

<h2>The first section</h2>

<p>First section of the route was meant to be difficult and involve a fair amount of hill climbing. Even though I knew the elevation chart the route felt more demanding than I expected. The first few kilometers were especially unpleasant and I had all sorts of negative thoughts in my head. Darkness, headaches and a slight nausea did little to improve the mood. To fool myself I pretended that I&rsquo;m going to go home once the first section is over.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/18983445849"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/378/18983445849_e167a069a1_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/19143425246"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/446/19143425246_60568cd5c2_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>At about 5 in the morning, as the sun was slowly rising behind mountains, I climbed Brünig pass. Getting over the pass broke a psychological barrier. I knew that the worst uphill is over even as the elapsed distance was still insignificant.</p>

<p>At some point I felt really sleepy and decided to take an hour nap on a bench in a forest. I&rsquo;ve managed to get 30 minutes of sleep as the body was all too excited to rest for too long.</p>

<h2>The second section</h2>

<p>By the time I finished the first section I realized that I am hopelessly behind the original optimistic estimates. I was already 2 hours behind. Making it on time for the last train back home quickly morphed into an unrealistic fantasy. Fantasies are better suited for sitting at home with a cup of warm tea in front of a fireplace.</p>

<p>Predictably, I could not imagine riding the remaining 250 kilometers. I fooled myself again into cycling to the end of second section where my wife met me for lunch in a cafe. To make up for the slow speed I pushed really hard to finish by 16:00.</p>

<p>At the top of the last hill before a speedy descent into Pfäffikon I met a Swiss couple who were leisurely cycling and appreciating the scenery. After a quick exchange of pleasantries the man asked whether I&rsquo;m &ldquo;genießen&rdquo; (enjoying) my ride. His tone and posture made me imagine him with a glass of fine whiskey and a cigar: &ldquo;Sir, are you enjoying the splendid surroundings of Schwyz?&rdquo;. &ldquo;Most certainly, what an exquisite enjoyment it is&rdquo;.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/19169589025"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/357/19169589025_5e96b94d99_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>Pushing hard payed off as I remarkably arrived at 16:00 sharp! I gulped down a few glasses of delicous lemonade and ordered a main course.</p>

<h2>The final section</h2>

<p>Less than a half remained and I spinned enthusiastically. I went fast for about 4 hours before breaking down again. A proper meal feels substantial compared to sugary drinks and sport bars that burn out quickly and leave a sore aftertaste. I stopped for a quick meal at McDonalds and continued to the final 6 hour stretch.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, my leg muscles did not show any signs of exhaustion. My ass, on the other hand, hurt as hell! I suppose no matter how great a bicycle seat is it&rsquo;s no match for 27 hour rides. The pain is unavoidable. Moving around just makes things worse.</p>

<p>I started to have hallucinations. I found a good solution: to focus on the road and avoid looking at any objects, especially if the objects seem interesting.</p>

<p>The final 10 kilometers felt like an eternity: so far no matter how close. Time perception gets really distorted in moments like these.</p>

<h2>Arrival and going home</h2>

<p>I arrived at 01:45 in the morning to the city of Rorschach. As most German or Swiss towns it was completely dead and quiet at night. The first train left at 05:40 and none of the hotels had a 24-hour reception. I went to the train station and parked my bike next to a bench and tried to stay warm. I was uncontrollably shaking because my clothing was too thin for sitting still. The good thing about sleep deprivation though is that it makes time fly. Every time I peaked on my wristwatch from waking up from cold the time advanced 30-40 minutes. Time flies when you&rsquo;re sleep deprived!</p>

<h2>Impressions</h2>

<p>It has been an extraordinary ride. I would have never completed it if I knew all the gory detail of the terrain or that 15-20% of roads were unpaved. More than anything, it has been a battle with the mind. My mind was endlessly coming up with excuses to make a stop to end the suffering. But there was only one good way to stop the suffering: get to the destination. At that is achieved by spinning faster and not by having stops every 5 minutes.</p>

<p>When I arrived in the middle of night at the destination shaking from hypothermia I was thinking of a warm bed, food and my beloved wife. In that moment I truly appreciated how much a place called home means to me. I wanted to go back to the beach vacation I berated so much&hellip;</p>

<p>But a good night sleep clears up even the muddiest minds. As soon as I woke up fresh and rested I dismissed the mumbo jumbo and started to plan another adventure. Challenge is an indispensable part of my identity and it&rsquo;s about time I finally learn it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="/blog/2015/06/26/longest-non-stop-bicycle-ride-in-my-life/">Success! I&rsquo;ve managed to complete the ride, totaling 420.8 km and 4953m of vertical ascent in 27 hours of biking.</a></p>

<p>Last year I&rsquo;ve successfully completed a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/200401002">300km bicycle day ride</a> and earned a new personal record for distance. On a wonderful day of today I&rsquo;m going to set a new personal record and ride for 400-or-so kilometers across Switzerland in less than 24 hours.</p>

<p>My route follows a slightly shortened version of the official Swiss route number 9:</p>

<p><a href="/images/400km_ride.png"><img src="/images/400km_ride.png" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The preparations are off to a rocky start. After thoroughly cleaning the bike and relubing mechanical parts I couldn&rsquo;t get flat pedals off. I&rsquo;d like to ride this distance with clipless pedals for higher efficiency.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/19079701705"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/368/19079701705_b4b79347b8.jpg" width="213"></a><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/18459001303"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/497/18459001303_24d1ceb4e1_n.jpg" width="480"></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to pay a visit to a local bike shop today and see if they can get them off. If not I&rsquo;ll have to keep using the flat pedals and possibly replace the whole crankset upon returning. That&rsquo;s an expensive way to learn to apply liberal amounts of anti-seize compound! Anyway, I&rsquo;ve somehow managed to ride 300km on the flats last year so perhaps it&rsquo;s not such a big problem after all.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve studied the route and divided it into 3 parts. The first 160km are the hardest: there are a couple of hills and one pass on the way. The second section is 80km and is of medium difficulty. The last part is almost as a flat as possible on this planet, starting with a fast descent.</p>

<p>As soon as I get over the first part I can make a deep breath. And once two sections are behind it&rsquo;s a piece of cake and I just need to make sure I don&rsquo;t fall of the bike due to sleep deprivation. I&rsquo;m also going to turn off any time-keeping and elapsed distance displays to keep my spirits going against the monstrous remaining distance.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m packing lots of high-calorie snacks and substances, such as protein and sport bars, sport drink mixtures and magnesium tablets. I plan to make one stop for lunch in Pfäffikon at about 14:00 in a cafe <a href="http://cellos-essbar.ch/">Cello&rsquo;s ESSBAR</a>. My wife plans to join me.</p>

<p>I am starting the ride today <strong>2015-06-23</strong> at <strong>22:30 CET</strong> (<strong>13:30 US/Pacific</strong>) from a town called Gstaad. I plan to arrive at the destination town Rorschach no later than <strong>2015-06-24</strong> at <strong>22:00 CET</strong> (<strong>13:00 US/Pacific</strong>). If I don&rsquo;t make it on time there is a risk there won&rsquo;t be any trains going and I will be stranded either in Rorscharh or Zürich Hauptbahnof.</p>

<p>I will be posting regular updates on my Facebook as I go and I will publish a full write-up once I come back and recover after a healthy amount of sleep. My dear friends, I need your full support to get through this!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I always wanted to experiment with night photographs of the sky. A pre-requisite is a clear sky and as little light pollution as possible. The island of Rodos in Greece is a perfect contender.</p>

<p>Me and my wife took our little rental car and drove along the road while we searched for pitch black spots and possible places to stop. We found an ancient silk factory:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/18314135863"><img src="/images/starlit-rodos.jpg" width="427"></a></p>

<p>The result seems okay for a first try. I admit it was a bit scary to stand alone in the darkness in a middle of nowhere.</p>

<p>I woke up at five in the morning today and headed to the airport with my beloved wife to fly out to celebrate our wedding anniversary on one of the beautiful Greek islands. As I am typing this on my computer during the flight I do not yet fully comprehend that our vacation is not going to end like most vacations do: two weeks later at the office. That is because earlier in May I inked a decision to voluntarily resign from one of the best places to work in the world. Since I made the announcement I have been predominantly asked three questions:</p>

</ol>


<p>I would like to share what made me make such a difficult decision. Hopefully, this short reflection helps others in their search of meaning and happiness. Writing also helps me to make sense of my own life and turn ephemeral, and often confusing, thoughts into concrete insights.</p>

<p><strong>tldr;</strong> answers are as follows: to discover my true passion, I don&rsquo;t know for certain, nothing for a while and then prepare for whatever I choose next.</p>

<p>There was nothing rash or sudden in my actions. If anything, I thought about it beforehand obsessively for several years. The balance of scales was finally disturbed last year when I went on a four week motorcycle tour of Norway and Sweden. Time alone on the road did not give many opportunities to think as I was preoccupied with looking for the fun roads, food and places to stay. But reflections, insights and thoughts stormed their way into my mind in the aftermath, as I reached home. Despite the engine roar, the twists and various incidents I felt calm and free during my little adventure. I felt no worry. But upon returning to the daily work routine the contrast was so stark that my hands began to shake. Stress has quickly re-established its elevated residency which I had not ever noticed before the trip. The background stress is toxic to the body but it is difficult to detect, just like the frog can&rsquo;t notice increasingly hot water it&rsquo;s in until the poor creature boils to death.</p>

<p>It is then that it became obvious to me that I must change either my ways of living or my attitude if I want to exist harmoniously and happily. It something easier said in hindsight as there&rsquo;s rarely a clear unambiguous signal to act in our complex entangled lives. History does not exist while the events are still unfolding. Similarly, factors and reasons rarely come together as neatly as they seem in the retrospect. Furthermore, real decisions usually have a steep price to pay and require to give up something valuable in return. I value and cherish many things that my way of living has given me up to the pivotal moment. Few other have had such gifts from the lady fortune. I found it difficult to seek understanding and support as there are few people I know who wouldn&rsquo;t label me a self-entitled ungrateful and wasteful bastard.</p>

<p>Fear is the other force to hold back. Fear held me a prisoner for years. One expects fear to be pretty obvious though I found it anything but. I have some credentials to back up my stance. In the last couple of years I skydived AFF (which means I did the first jump solo, unlike being strapped to another skydiver in a tandem), rode down-hill mountain bike trails, rode a 200 horsepower motorbike around a race track and did some other feats considered scary and risky by (mostly incorrect) common sense. I know what the obvious fear feels like. The fear of change is different: it lies dormant like a crocodile that snaps its deadly claws upon the motion of potential prey. Only in the case of fear the prey is any kind of uncertainty and change. Human nature is soaked with the poison of fear and we don&rsquo;t realize it.</p>

<p>What was I in? By any objective measure I lived in a paradise: being part of one of the best companies in the world that has shaped humanity and will do so in the foreseeable decades. The compensation, perks, free food and amazing office facilities are nothing to complain about. Nor do humane bosses, tolerant atmosphere, intelligent colleagues, space for initiative and considerable freedom to choose what to work on. Yet something has been amiss from the head start: passion. From the moment I started I did not enjoy what I was doing. I struggled initially but over time I learned skills that made me adapt and grow tolerant. I even excelled by the prevailing performance standards. At times there were assignments that got me really excited but 80% of my work felt empty.</p>

<p>I have not spent the time lazily complaining about the circumstances. I used the opportunity to find meaning outside of profession. I tried out more hobbies than I have toes and fingers combined. I studied and worked on side projects and ideas. I devoured in an intimate relationship with my then-girlfriend wife. I traveled. I read ferociously. I went beyond the confines of my nature-given introversion to meet people and make friendships. I pursued spirituality. But there is only so much time in 24 hours. Dealing with work that does not excite saps you of energy and eventually shrinks the energy capacity. I had genuine opportunities at the company to change into a line of work that is closer to my interests but failed to seize them due to unfortunate combination of reasons. By now I have got very little energy left and I definitely couldn&rsquo;t pull two jobs at once which is somewhat a prerequisite for a successful transfer. I don&rsquo;t see how passion can be compensated. I feel that no amount of hobbies, relationships and interests can compensate an occupation that is out of line with one&rsquo;s values and passions.</p>

<p>Despite what the articles and books say discovering passion is not that obvious. The typical premise is to follow one&rsquo;s goals and values but if it was so simple there wouldn&rsquo;t be so many confused and lost souls. Personally, I find the discovery process the most difficult. I don&rsquo;t understand how anyone can know his values and passions without a serious deal of reflection work. I certainly don&rsquo;t believe that one can substitute the hard work with a half an hour exercise. Without trying out various things it&rsquo;s not possible to determine what one is really excited about. Discovering passion is a process of trial and error. Discovery is about exploring further what little we have experienced so far along with finding new turns. It is not unlike navigating a maze.</p>

<p>One serious obstacle to the process of self discovery is the denial of truth. While it&rsquo;s not possible to know what our passions are without trying we can seriously inhibit progress by refusing to pursue our callings. After graduating from university I chose to work outside of my field of interest. To be honest, I wasn&rsquo;t particularly sure what of the many specializations in my field I wanted to pursue either. But ever since I began to work I did not get closer to finding that out. Instead, I thought of hundreds of reasons why pursuing passion isn&rsquo;t worthwhile. With the right financial disincentives failure to ever return on the path of self actualization is almost guaranteed.</p>

<p>It is also puzzling to me why people living in a westernish modern world rarely ever consider taking a long break from work. We live in an era of unprecedented productivity and economic growth. Yet most of us sit chained to our desks for 8-14 hours a day as if we were coal miners of the bygone centuries. It is impossible to perform uninterrupted quality intellectual work for more than a few hours a day. Somehow we conveniently ignore the truth and let our minds rot while we make ourselves look busy and let the hours pass instead of perhaps lifting some weight to make our backs stronger or learning a new skill. Nobody benefits from the idle hours. It&rsquo;s the same with ridiculously short vacations. Two weeks of vacation cannot replenish an exhausted body and mind.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t wait to take a break for too long. If you&rsquo;re not feeling mostly passionate about what you do chances are you will eventually burn out. There&rsquo;s anxiety and depression around the corner and broken relationships and career prospects (who wants under-performers back?). Instead, plan ahead and do it gracefully: go out with a smile and respect, with friendships and good memories. I think I waited a tad too long but at least I did not experience a complete break down. I feel drained professionally but my inner drive is still alive and ready to kick in a high gear after some greasing.</p>

<p>With all of what I have that said, I don&rsquo;t regret the choice I had made years ago. If I had the opportunity to go back in time and make the choice again I would have picked the same option. I believe I made the right decision given the circumstances. I don&rsquo;t blame anyone for the final outcome. If anything, I&rsquo;m grateful to the company, to my bosses and to my colleagues. I strongly believe that the same job could be blissful and highly rewarding under the right mindset and circumstances. I believe life is not meant to be a perfect well rehearsed sequence of &ldquo;nexts&rdquo; and I have very few expectations about the future. Nobody but me has an obligation to make the most out of my life.</p>

<p>Quitting a great job and taking a long break is the most difficult decision I made in my life so far. There&rsquo;s so much I would like to change and to learn and to experience! It&rsquo;s time to recharge, instill new helpful habits and to prepare for whatever I choose as my next challenge.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On a hot Sunday I have joined a couple of cycling enthusiasts to cover an imperial century in the vicinity of canton Zurich:</p>

<p><a href="/images/century-ride.png"><img src="/images/century-ride.png" width="500"></a></p>

<p>I have not ridden a road bike for about a year. This was the first serious ride for the bike I had picked up on a sale last year:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/18091049284"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/451/18091049284_e1861dc5f6_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>It is equipped with one of those fancy Di2 drive-trains which I &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; to extend the standard 10-speed casette to a 11-speed one.</p>

<p><em>Total distance</em>: 162.3km</p>

<p><em>Total vertical ascent</em>: 1182m</p>

<p><em>Difficulty</em>: easy</p>

<p><a href="/files/century-ride.gpx">Download GPS (direct)</a></p>

<p>The ride went much smoother and faster than I expected. I forgot just how much difference there is between a mountain bike and a road bike. Keeping a speed of 25-30kmh on flats is so much less effort than my trusted Salsa Fargo.</p>

<p>There is definitely less comfort on this bike. I could ride my Fargo for 300km per day and feel no pain or discomfort. My hands were definitely tired after a day of riding on the road bike. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine going on a tour on a bike like this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&rsquo;s a short summary of the ride:</p>

<p><a href="/images/zug-ziegelbrucke.png"><img src="/images/zug-ziegelbrucke.png" width="500"></a></p>

<p>On a Saturday two weeks ago I went on a bike ride from Zug to Ziegelbrucke through Einsideln and Pfaffikon. I was pretty familiar with many parts of the route.</p>

<p>I have experimented with Microsoft&rsquo;s Hyperlapse Pro software that renders video footage into fast-paced but stable fly-throughs. I am thoroughly impressed with the results and I plan to use it in future biking and hiking trips:</p>

<p>I have never biked or walked along the Obersee (the smaller lake linked to Zurich lake on the East side) so I was delighted by the nice unpaved road along the Northern side of the lake as well as pretty views to the local peaks:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On May 13th I established a new personal record for the longest non-stop hike in my life. Not only it involved 52km and 12 hours of walking but also an ascent of 1500m up to Rigi mountain at the very end of the hike.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/307842580">View our GPS track on Strava</a></p>

<p>Me and my friend Ilya have participated in an annual Swiss event called Rigimarsch. It is a night time hike from a town called Bremgarten all the way up to the Rigi mountain. This year the event attracted 2112 participants.</p>

<p>Note how uplifted we were in the beginning:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/18037115871"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7734/18037115871_4bd103eb54.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The registration normally starts at 19:30. It took us about 40 minutes to go through the queue. Despite a lot people the queue was handled efficiently and everyone was friendly. I was surprised to see so many young people as well as older folks and 12 year olds. The biggest surprise was to see them finish!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tentaclephotos/17848376818"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5343/17848376818_ea621aca86.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The weather conditions were perfect. The air was warm during the whole night and we felt comfortable in t-shirts. The first 2 hours of the hike were accompanied by a spectacle of lightnings. Luckily for us it never rained.</p>

<p>The event was exceptionally well executed. There were people regulating the traffic on every intersection of the hiking path with public roads. The route was well indicated with small flags and lamps. It was impossible to get lost. Also, the line of hikers never broke so there were always people in front and ahead of us.</p>

<p>In case someone got tired there were 5 stops where you could take a break, have a snack and take a bus back.</p>

<p>From the 25th kilometer onwards we could see the mountain ahead in the distance. The peak slowly crept closer and closer as our elapsed distance accumulated roughly 40 relatively flat kilometeres. At that point I realized that we still have a mountain to climb. It was gruesome. I could only look at my feet and make one step at a time. I couldn&rsquo;t dare to look up and see just how high we need to go.</p>

<p>The views were fantastic but I felt so tired I could barely continue. I recall feeling really sick and close to throwing up. The last 200 metres up to the summit seemed like eternity.</p>

<p>Note how tired we looked at the end:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have previuosly written a <a href="/blog/2015/02/01/beginners-guide-to-802-dot-11ac-setup/">guide to configure a 802.11ac access point using hostapd in gentoo linux</a>. Another enthusiast discovered that my guide does not lead to a working access point. Turns out I missed crucial steps to configure DFS which is required for operating on higher frequencies. In this guide I diagnose the problem and correct the mistakes. I also show how to increase transmission (TX) power of the wireless card.</p>

<h2>Diagnose the issue</h2>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s wrong with the existing configuration. We will look at the daemon output to troubleshoot. Stop the hostapd service and then start it manually in foreground with:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The output shows us that hostapd was unable to start due to DFS failure (line &ldquo;DFS start_dfs_cac() failed, -1&rdquo;). It means that DFS is not available so we can&rsquo;t choose a channel that requires DFS. We can double check the local regulations using:</p>

<p>The output shows that frequencies above 5250 Mhz require DFS. This means that channels >52 won&rsquo;t work unless DFS is functional. Let&rsquo;s cross check supported radio channels using &ldquo;iw&rdquo;:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>&ldquo;no IR&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;no initiate radiation&rdquo;. It essentially means that the card cannot be used as an access point on that frequency. However, when &ldquo;no IR&rdquo; goes in hand with &ldquo;radar detection&rdquo; it means that the card can be used but only with DFS. It&rsquo;s another reminder that DFS is required.</p>

<h2>Fix the issue by disabling DFS</h2>

<p>An obvious solution is to avoid using DFS by choosing a channel that does not require radar detection. In the case of Switzerland channel 44 is a safe choice.</p>

<p>To disable DFS and to choose a channel that does not require DFS do following changes to the configuration file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ap ~ # vi /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>...
</span><span class='line'>channel=44
</span><span class='line'>...
</span><span class='line'>ieee80211h=0
</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Save the changes and restart hostapd. Everything should work now. Enabling DFS is by no means necessary. In fact, I&rsquo;m running my access point on a frequency which does not require DFS. I observe significantly better transfer rates on non-DFS channels.</p>

<p>However, if you&rsquo;re curious and/or would like to get DFS to work read on.</p>

<h2>Enable DFS support in the kernel</h2>

<p>It turns out that DFS must be enabled in kernel and by default the option is hidden from kernel configuration dialogs. To check if DFS is enabled look through kernel message output:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ap ~ # dmesg
</span><span class='line'>...
</span><span class='line'>[    2.850086] ath10k_pci 0000:04:00.0: debug 1 debugfs 1 tracing 0 dfs 0 testmode 0
</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The output indicates that DFS is disabled (&ldquo;dfs 0&rdquo;). To enable DFS you must enable following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Configure standard kernel features (expert users)&rdquo; under &ldquo;General Setup&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;cfg80211 certification onus&rdquo; under &ldquo;Networking support > Wireless&rdquo;</li>

<p>Re-compile the kernel and verify if the kernel output indicates DFS support. Then, re-enable DFS and choose a higher channel of your liking.</p>

<p>I have experimented with the higher channels but I discovered throughput was significantly worse. In addition, not all client machines recognize upper 5Ghz channels. For example, EU version of Asus PCE-AC68 card in Windows doesn&rsquo;t function on channels >48. A <a href="http://www.snbforums.com/threads/pce-ac66-wifi-card-not-picking-up-5ghz-149-161-channels.10932/">work-around soltion</a> is to alter the driver&rsquo;s *.ini file and re-install the driver:</p>

<h2>Fix DFS-UNSET problem</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re seeing &ldquo;DFS-UNSET&rdquo; in &ldquo;iw reg get&rdquo; output upgrade crda package to at least version 3.18.</p>

<h2>Increase TX power</h2>

<p>Local regulations dictate maximum radiation power and operating frequencies. Certain radios are hard-coded to geographical regions, e.g. United States. Regulatory compliance software runs the strictest set of rules that intersect the pre-programmed and chosen regions. In other words, a radio that is pre-programmed for US and is operated in Switzerland will disable channels that are prohibited in US but perfectly legal in Switzerland. Same goes for power. Radio will operate on the lowest power allowed in the two regions. To overcome these limitations it is sometimes possible to re-program the radio&rsquo;s EEPROM and set a different region.</p>

<p>A simpler solution is to alter the regulations which are maintained by the wireless software stack and not the radio itself. On Linux the idea is to compile a custom regulatory daemon which allows a modified set of regulations. The regulations themselves are modified by replacing entries corresponding to the hard-coded radio region to whatever is desired by the user:</p>

<ol>
<li>download wireless-regdb package, unpack</li>
<li>modify &ldquo;db.txt&rdquo; file by replacing entries corresponding to the radio&rsquo;s region with desired configuration. In my case I search for Swiss regulations (CH) and copy them over the rules for US and 00 (00 stands for global).</li>
<li>run &ldquo;make&rdquo;</li>
<li>copy generated rule set out: cp regulatory.bin /usr/lib/crda/regulatory.bin</li>
<li>download crda package, unpack</li>
<li>copy *pem files from wireless-regdb folder to crda/pubkeys subfolder</li>
<li>run &ldquo;make&rdquo;, followed by &ldquo;make install&rdquo;</li>
<li>reboot</li>
</ol>


<p>This procedure generates a custom regulatory daemon that trusts the set of regulations we have altered. Obviously, these changes won&rsquo;t persist after a package upgrade so you would need to repeat them should newer packages get released.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not difficult to inadvertently break your local laws by altering regulatory restrictions so be careful with the changes. Try also not to fry yourself with radiation.</p>
