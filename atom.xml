    <updated>2014-02-07T17:45:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2014/02/07/coffee-is-not-my-friend</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About 2 years ago I completely gave up on caffeine. I&rsquo;ve stopped drinking coffee, most kinds of tea and caffeinated beverages such as diet coke. Giving up was not that difficult. I&rsquo;ve never been a die hard fan of coffee though I savor a well prepared black tea and an occasional coke.</p>

<p>A negative consequence of completely giving up on caffeine is that even the tiniest bit disrupts a good night sleep. Feel like a having a cold bursting diet coke at 4pm? Face insomnia the following night! Same for tea or anything containing caffeine. I had adapted by finding valid substitutes. A cold highly carbonated water is as satisfying as a diet coke. Nothing trumps black tea but rooibos tea is enjoyable in its own way.</p>

<p>Back in the day I don&rsquo;t remember if giving up on caffeine had made any life improvements. A couple of months ago I started having difficulties falling asleep quickly so I decided to carry out a couple of experiments. One of the experiments was to consume caffeine in large quantities (5+ caffeinated beverages per day). The experiment handsomely reminded me of all the benefits of not being addicted to the mainstream drug of caffeine!</p>

<p>But I digress, there are observable benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>My heart rate has dropped. Increased heart rate was one of the factors that kept me up at night.</p></li>
<li><p>I feel energized and enthusiastic. I feel excited doing things that normally get postponed. Even mundane things get done with a spark of creativity.</p></li>
<li><p>I can sustain energized and enthusiastic performance for about 4-6 hours. This has to be supported by regular caffeine consumption.</p></li>
<li><p>There&rsquo;s a pronounced sharp productivity and energy crash in the evening at about 5-6pm. While the crash prevents me from doing creative work in the evening it allows me to disconnect quickly and relax. More on that later.</p></li>
<li><p>Surprisingly, I fall asleep much quicker! While I could have previously lied in bed for 15-45+ minutes now I lose grip on reality in a couple of minutes at most and less than a minute at best.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve continued with the experiment for about 4 weeks. I am abandoning it because I find the habit completely incompatible with my lifestyle and the following negative effects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Headaches. I get headaches if I don&rsquo;t consume enough. When I wake up I have about one hour to drink a cup of coffee before strong headaches kick in. In the evenings the headaches are partially responsible for impairing any remaining productivity. I tried going without coffee one Saturday. I could not focus on anything. I vaguely recognize this feeling from the days when I had been a regular coffee drinker. It never occurred to me that coffee could be causing this.</p></li>
<li><p>Aggression, anxiety, impatience. In the moments when I don&rsquo;t get a caffeine &ldquo;fix&rdquo; I feel increased level of negative emotions and impatience. Even the most innocent behaviors drive me mad. Curiously, before I gave up coffee 2 years ago I never attributed caffeine as a source of anxiousness and irritability.</p></li>
<li><p>Longer sleep. Although I fall asleep much quicker now and subjectively have great sleep the objective quality must have deteriorated because I need more time to get to a rested state. Sleep is important for me (and should be for everyone in his right mind). I know I&rsquo;m rested when I wake up before the alarm clock goes off. With caffeine I need 2 extra hours to get there.</p></li>
<li><p>Productivity crash. I&rsquo;ve listed it as a benefit but it&rsquo;s also a curse. I find it next to impossible to work on anything in the evening. Evening time is sacred to me. It&rsquo;s when I can do something creative or engage in a side project or read or think. Frankly, I can do nothing now. I can&rsquo;t even read articles and news from my curated RSS feed. I can only imagine watching mindless TV but luckily I don&rsquo;t have one.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m currently on track to reduce caffeine consumption to no more than 1 cup of coffee a day plus a couple of cups of tea. I&rsquo;m doing this to keep immunity from caffeine&rsquo;s effect on sleep while reaping some of the benefits like reduced heart rate. I don&rsquo;t know how useful such a compromise will be but in a couple of weeks I should have a realistic understanding.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see a reason to ever come back to consuming as much caffeine as I did in the past and during the last 4 weeks. I imagine caffeine is one bad habit that keeps a lot of unaware people in a bad loop. No wonder that few ever want to do anything exciting in the evening when the crash makes you feel so devastated and you think that&rsquo;s normal.</p>

<p>I suppose caffeine has its place. I imagine coffee as a kind of &ldquo;turbo boost&rdquo; button in a critical situation when every extra bit of creativity and energy is needed. This &ldquo;turbo boost&rdquo; comes with sizable payback and so should be used sparingly.</p>

    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2014/02/02/photo-report-intentionality</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been lately practicing intentional photography &ndash; having a purpose and a general idea/plan in mind before making captures. The biggest change I&rsquo;ve noticed is that the number of keepers has risen from an average of 2-6% to 15-25%!</p>

<p>Below I present two projects that I undertook during a recent stay in Seattle, Washington.</p>

<h2>Trainspotting</h2>

<p>I love trains. It turns out that I love making pictures of them too! I suspect that together with landscapes and abandoned places trains are my favorite subjects.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68217075@N08/12248701365"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2862/12248701365_0cff763be3_c.jpg" width="800"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68217075@N08/12248668105"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7305/12248668105_ab33bde7be_q.jpg" width="150"></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68217075@N08/12248850553"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5485/12248850553_2167955d74_q.jpg" width="150"></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68217075@N08/12248671175"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3800/12248671175_349365dcb4_q.jpg" width="150"></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68217075@N08/12248664195"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5506/12248664195_5d66f5709d_q.jpg" width="150"></a></p>

<p>I have asked a colleague to provide a map with markers to local trainspotting places. On a Saturday morning I packed the gear and went walking along one of the major lines.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68217075@N08/12248656935"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3738/12248656935_7a8f7bf725_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68217075@N08/12249263096"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3781/12249263096_f822922ec8_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68217075@N08/12249122624"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7344/12249122624_b9421dfc87_z.jpg" width="640"></a></p>

<p>I did not feel safe. Everywhere I found signs saying that trespassing is illegal and that BNSF police is going to arrest me. I was careful not to cross any legal lines. I wish I could get closer.</p>

<h2>Chronos</h2>

<p>For the second project I took pictures of clocks I could find in our Seattle office. The building screams with interesting art objects and decorations.</p>

<p>The city is walkable and has great infrastructure. I found bike lanes everywhere and public transport. It&rsquo;s the first US city that I find appealing.</p>

    <link href="http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2014/01/07/dilbert-cartoonist-on-goals/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-07T21:38:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2014/01/07/dilbert-cartoonist-on-goals</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have just finished reading Scott Adams&#8217; book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still-ebook/dp/B00FHI0XK2">How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life</a>. In the book the cartoonist behind Dilbert comic shares his views on success in a witty and humorous way.</p>

<p>He talks about goals among other things. He finds goals to be inadequate for long-term personal success. Among the reasons is the perpetual feeling of failure. And what do you do after reaching a goal? Goals are not relevant for ongoing improvements, like staying fit and well rested. Instead, the author argues for the value of creating habits (or systems, as he calls them) to keep essential efforts going.</p>

<p>The idea struck a chord with me. <a href="http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2013/12/25/on-goals-and-purpose/">As I&rsquo;ve written before</a> I had never found goals to be especially useful in life. Not only I can&rsquo;t find any motivation for reaching arbitrary targets I also don&rsquo;t understand what am I supposed to do when I reach them. Suppose I&rsquo;ve put a goal to lift a certain weight. Should I stop exercising once I can do it? Pushing goals further is not workable either. I can&rsquo;t increase my strength forever &ndash; there is a limit.</p>

<p>Forming habits has always worked for me. I had spent a considerable amount of willpower once to fall in love with exercising daily. Now I feel bad if I don&rsquo;t do it. I occasionally break out of the routine (e.g. when I travel for weeks at a time) but resuming is never a hassle. However, I find habits/systems to be out of place for things that are to be enjoyed sporadically. It is a lousy habit to go to the cinema every week because it won&rsquo;t be fun.</p>

<p>Also, the line between habits and goals is a fine one. A habit to meditate daily can be framed as a goal. I don&rsquo;t have a good enough grasp to put a clearly defined distinction. Goals are well defined targets with specific dates attached to them. Habits are a collection of embraced practices to continuously maintain and improve prioritized areas of life without excessively expending willpower. More generally, I can think of habits as processes that solve problems and dilemmas of life to get me closer to what I consider important.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the book. Although there&rsquo;s more circumstantial evidence than scientific proof I have discovered a couple of valuable ideas to evaluate and to experiment with. I suggest to read <a href="http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/12/scott-adams-fail-at-everything/">Farnam Street Blog post about this book</a> for an expanded overview.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-02T13:15:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2014/01/02/6-months-on-a-bike</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like bicycles. I like riding them, I like fiddling with them. But for some reason I never consistently commuted by bicycle. 6 months ago I made a decision to commute by bicycle every single day regardless of the weather. Even if it rains or storms or snows.</p>

<p>As it turns out adverse weather conditions are conquerable with appropriate gear. I am lucky that I have an opportunity to change clothes and take a shower upon my arrival at work. Item by item I arrived at the following clothes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gore-tex bike jacket</li>
<li>Wind/water proof trousers</li>
<li>2 synthetic shirts (depending on the temperature I either wear one or two)</li>
<li>Gore-tex bike gloves + undergloves</li>
<li>Gore-tex outdoor shoes + water shoe covers</li>
</ul>


<p>The coldest days are yet to come (so far the coldest has been -3C). I expect that I will need to wear underpants and possibly another shirt when the temperature drops to -7/-10C.</p>

<p>Bike pictures before cleaning and service:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made a lot of upgrades to my commuter/touring bike. It started as a <a href="http://www.bmc-racing.com/ch-en/bikes/2010/mountainroad/platform/mountainroad_series/alpenchallenge/ac01/standard/">BMC alpenchallenge AC01 from 2010</a>. Full list of upgrades:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shimano XT disc brakes (tried SRAM twice)</li>
<li>SRAM X.0 rear derailleur</li>
<li>SRAM X.0 shifters</li>
<li>Shimano 105 crankset</li>
<li>Wippermann Connex black chain</li>
<li>DMR V12 pedals</li>
<li>Ergon GP3 grips</li>
<li>Specialized toupe 143 saddle</li>
<li>Garmin 800 computer (shared with 2 other bikes)</li>
<li>2x Lenzyne superdrive front lights (shared with 2 other bikes)</li>
<li>Cateye TL-LD610 rear light</li>
<li>Topeak defender M2 rear fender</li>
<li>Racktime ADDit rear pannier rack</li>
<li>Ortlieb classic waterproof rear pannier bags</li>
</ul>


<p>This configuration suits me very well. Everything works smoothly and the bike is exceptionally quiet on the road.</p>

<p>The R script does not work anymore! It turns out that Yahoo has disabled URL &ldquo;charts.yahoo.com&rdquo;. However, &ldquo;icharts.finance.yahoo.com&rdquo; works fine. The problem is that the URL is hard coded into <strong>quantmod</strong> package.</p>

<p>The quick solution is to check-out latest code and build the package from source. The alternative is to wait until CRAN includes quantmod with the fix applied. Here&rsquo;s how I fixed the problem:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># check-out latest quantmod code using subversion
</span><span class='line'>$ svn checkout svn://svn.r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/quantmod/
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># build and install the package from a local folder
</span><span class='line'>$ R CMD INSTALL quantmod/pkg/</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As of <strong>2013-12-31</strong> the best performing instruments are:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>16.97135 16.93180 14.93496</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>No changes in positions.</p>

<p>We avoid investing if price is below 10 month SMA. Running through 10-month SMA check we get:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>This means portfolio should be fully invested in <strong>VBK</strong>, <strong>VBR</strong>, <strong>VTV</strong>.</p>

    <updated>2013-12-25T19:58:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2013/12/25/on-goals-and-purpose</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s Eve evoke mass hysteria to reflect and to resolve to change unlike any other time of the year. People write down goals for themselves, think about their purpose in life. Planning and goal setting are praised important even outside of the festivities.</p>

<p>I believe it&rsquo;s mostly harmless but also pointless. I look back to the moment I first embraced the Western custom of goal setting and I don&rsquo;t have much to show for it. Most of the things I have written down for myself became either unimportant or neglected. Any remarkable moments and achievements have been unexpected, spontaneous or had very little to do with the planning.</p>

<p>For one, goals are thought to be an explicit expression of one&rsquo;s desires and life values. It follows that we are fully aware of what is truly important to us and that it&rsquo;s possible to translate our priorities into conscious plans. However, I personally find a significant disconnect between conscious thought and implicit life values. It&rsquo;s difficult to crystallize the  value &ldquo;compass&rdquo; in words. Plans that come out of a rational mind can be in conflict with  governing values.</p>

<p>I have a personal illustration. I have never put the relationship with my wife as a priority or in any of the goals. However, in moments of distress I have dropped everything to take care of her. None of the goals mattered in that instant. I realize now just how important she is for me. Consciously, I did not rank the relationship high in my list of priorities and goals. But subconsciously I knew what is going to rule my behavior, especially in times of difficulty.</p>

<p>Secondly, goals have costs. It is one thing to write goals down. It is another to accept sacrifices that might be required to make them happen. I&rsquo;ve heard complaints about lines of work that are not terribly exciting. Along the complaints came aspirations for entrepreneurship and exhilarating work at emerging start-ups. I confess that the thought is contagious. I entertained it myself. But then I realized that this change has a cost and that I highly value what I already have.</p>

<p>Taken together, these two factors are responsible for destroying many naive goal setting efforts. Symptoms may differ but at the core the problem is that goals simply don&rsquo;t truly matter to the person setting them. It won&rsquo;t help to break down a goal into smaller goals or to have regular progress reviews. It just doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>

<p>I often recall an episode when I was about 10 years old. Two of my friends were coached by their parents to think about their lives and set goals and do all sorts of ridiculous &ldquo;self development&rdquo; exercises. I haven&rsquo;t done any of that. Yet all of the things I appreciate this very day did not come out of any priority list.</p>

<p>I believe there is a place for planning but life is not one of them. I see goals useful when an issue is well understood. Setting goals to win a specific sports competition is a technical matter. On the other hand, setting a goal to enter a competition in the first place is an entirely different thing.</p>

<p>My resolution for this NY is to stop doing useless bullshit personal goal setting crap.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The weather on weekends has been excellent lately. On December 8th me and my friend John went for a snowshoe hike close to Braunwald.</p>

<p>It was so warm that we took off our jackets.</p>

<p>The hike took about 4 hours. There&rsquo;s plenty of snow and we got our snowshoes on in about 35 minutes after beginning the trek.</p>

    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2013/11/26/feeding-brains</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finding good sources of information is similar to finding a good diet &mdash; there is an overwhelming amount of stuff available (abundance of calories) but the utility (healthiness) of it is close to zero. Many news outlets and online media have incentives that are in conflict with providing thoughtful quality material. Media chases advertisements. In the race to achieve highest numbers of visits and ad impressions it shamelessly bombards us readers with juicy junk articles with loud headlines that shamelessly grab our attention. These articles give a quick gratification but in the long-term rob us of thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see an immediate solution that works for the whole society. However, that does not preclude me from avoiding the poison altogether. I intentionally avoid mainstream news. I don&rsquo;t get sucked into politics and my perception of the world is not skewed by the over representation of certain topics (such as airplane crashes). I don&rsquo;t blindly follow industry news either. There are lots of new tools, frameworks and gadgets coming out every day. It&rsquo;s impossible to learn everything so I prefer to focus on lasting ideas and skills. I can pick-up and learn ephemeral details whenever I have a specific task at hand.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t passively follow what is currently trending or popular. Instead, I actively seeks news through a curated list of blogs and news sources. Even with a curated list I had problems getting overwhelmed with too many items. A low signal to noise ratio takes a lot of effort to deal with.</p>

<p>From now on I will maintain an updated list of RSS feeds of blogs and websites that I am subscribed to on the <a href="http://drseergio.github.io/news-sources">News sources</a> page.</p>

    <updated>2013-11-25T21:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2013/11/25/doing-it-my-way</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a habit of regularly reading books that are of pseudo spiritual and self help and personal growth nature. I did not follow their contents word for word but I believed I could glean useful solutions to life problems and new ways to think about reality. Recently, I came to a conclusion that I&rsquo;m not going to read such books anymore. No more productivity books. No more books on settings goals. No more books on personal growth.</p>

<p>At the core of my discontent is a realization that every person exists within a unique set of circumstances. The set of circumstances benefits from a matching set of solutions. Solutions could be anything from spiritual beliefs and value systems to productivity habits and strategies. Whenever a person observes himself succeeding in light of his actions he entrenches in conviction that his discoveries are universal.</p>

<p>I have a problem with this premise. Even in relatively similar environments every person is shaped by an intersection of local influences, actions, ideas, challenges and opportunities. I don&rsquo;t believe there are universal truths as to how to run distinctive lives. Trying to blindly follow someone else&rsquo;s beliefs is akin to dull imitation. In addition, the result is likely to be irrelevant and misplaced.</p>

<p>Most of the self help literature builds upon anecdotes &mdash; stories of highly successful people (I&rsquo;m talking about success in its widest meaning, anything between spiritual enlightenment and lucrative business empire). Authors conveniently escape talking about failures and millions of interrelated things that contribute to extraordinary outcomes. I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s possible to extract specific traits or behaviors that guarantee success. Some highly successful people are punctual. Others never gave shit about being organized yet are arguably in the same success &ldquo;league&rdquo;.</p>

<p>After all the hours spent on reading these books I&rsquo;ve embraced introspection as an alternative tool. Instead of looking outwards to find solutions I look into myself to understand what challenges I face, what is important, what brings happiness and joy. I also take a moment to appreciate what I already have.</p>

<p>See what I have done here? Exactly what the self help literature does. I&rsquo;ve imposed personal experience to provide seemingly helpful guidance. The problem is that this &ldquo;guidance&rdquo; builds upon my perception and a set of beliefs that are likely to be very different from yours. Maybe if I&rsquo;ve never read any of the self help books my stance would be different. Perhaps you should read all the self help books you can and come to the same conclusion independently.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s anything to take away then it&rsquo;s that it helps to be critical when reading other people&rsquo;s ideas.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been sick in and out with all kinds of cold during past several weeks. I had a lucky break last weekend and went for a snowshoe hike in Arosa, Switzerland.</p>

<p>It has been the first time I&rsquo;ve taken the snowshoes on. I had a misconception that snowshoes will let you float on the surface. They won&rsquo;t. After a couple of hours I got a hang of it and could even run. I know I&rsquo;ll be spending time outdoors so I splurged on luxurious MSR ascent snowshoes. These snowshoes have good grip &ndash; I could not slide even if I wanted to.</p>

<p>The hike itself has been rather easy and there was not much snow. However, it has been a good opportunity to get used to the snowshoes.</p>

<p>We have spent the day bathing in sun above a fog that covered most of central Switzerland. On our way back there was a 2 minute opportunity to shoot the fog and the sunset before descending back into fog&rsquo;s vast but short-lived kingdom (we were changing train to bus as the regular train route was blocked by a rockfall).</p>
