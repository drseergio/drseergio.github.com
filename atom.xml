    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like bicycles. I like riding them, I like fiddling with them. But for some reason I never consistently commuted by bicycle. 6 months ago I made a decision to commute by bicycle every single day regardless of the weather. Even if it rains or storms or snows.</p>

<p>As it turns out adverse weather conditions are conquerable with appropriate gear. I am lucky that I have an opportunity to change clothes and take a shower upon my arrival at work. Item by item I arrived at the following clothes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gore-tex bike jacket</li>
<li>Wind/water proof trousers</li>
<li>2 synthetic shirts (depending on the temperature I either wear one or two)</li>
<li>Gore-tex bike gloves + undergloves</li>
<li>Gore-tex outdoor shoes + water shoe covers</li>
</ul>


<p>The coldest days are yet to come (so far the coldest has been -3C). I expect that I will need to wear underpants and possibly another shirt when the temperature drops to -7/-10C.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made a lot of upgrades to my commuter/touring bike. It started as a <a href="http://www.bmc-racing.com/ch-en/bikes/2010/mountainroad/platform/mountainroad_series/alpenchallenge/ac01/standard/">BMC alpenchallenge AC01 from 2010</a>. Full list of upgrades:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shimano XT disc brakes (tried SRAM twice)</li>
<li>SRAM X.0 rear derailleur</li>
<li>SRAM X.0 shifters</li>
<li>Shimano 105 crankset</li>
<li>Wippermann Connex black chain</li>
<li>DMR V12 pedals</li>
<li>Ergon GP3 grips</li>
<li>Specialized toupe 143 saddle</li>
<li>Garmin 800 computer (shared with 2 other bikes)</li>
<li>2x Lenzyne superdrive front lights (shared with 2 other bikes)</li>
<li>Cateye TL-LD610 rear light</li>
<li>Topeak defender M2 rear fender</li>
<li>Racktime ADDit rear pannier rack</li>
<li>Ortlieb classic waterproof rear pannier bags</li>
</ul>


<p>This configuration suits me very well. Everything works smoothly and the bike is exceptionally quiet on the road.</p>

    <link href="http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2014/01/02/investment-portfolio-update-december-2013/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>December&rsquo;s update</h3>

<p>The R script does not work anymore! It turns out that Yahoo has disabled URL &ldquo;charts.yahoo.com&rdquo;. However, &ldquo;icharts.finance.yahoo.com&rdquo; works fine. The problem is that the URL is hard coded into <strong>quantmod</strong> package.</p>

<p>The quick solution is to check-out latest code and build the package from source. The alternative is to wait until CRAN includes quantmod with the fix applied. Here&rsquo;s how I fixed the problem:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># check-out latest quantmod code using subversion
</span><span class='line'>$ svn checkout svn://svn.r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/quantmod/
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'># build and install the package from a local folder
</span><span class='line'>$ R CMD INSTALL quantmod/pkg/</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As of <strong>2013-12-31</strong> the best performing instruments are:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>VBK      VBR      VTV
</span><span class='line'>16.97135 16.93180 14.93496</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>No changes in positions.</p>

<p>We avoid investing if price is below 10 month SMA. Running through 10-month SMA check we get:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>VBK  VBR  VTV
</span><span class='line'>TRUE TRUE TRUE</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This means portfolio should be fully invested in <strong>VBK</strong>, <strong>VBR</strong>, <strong>VTV</strong>.</p>

<p>As of <strong>2013-12-31</strong> the calculated returns for each instrument are presented below(*):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

    <link href="http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2013/12/25/on-goals-and-purpose/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-25T19:58:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2013/12/25/on-goals-and-purpose</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s Eve evoke mass hysteria to reflect and to resolve to change unlike any other time of the year. People write down goals for themselves, think about their purpose in life. Planning and goal setting are praised important even outside of the festivities.</p>

<p>I believe it&rsquo;s mostly harmless but also pointless. I look back to the moment I first embraced the Western custom of goal setting and I don&rsquo;t have much to show for it. Most of the things I have written down for myself became either unimportant or neglected. Any remarkable moments and achievements have been unexpected, spontaneous or had very little to do with the planning.</p>

<p>For one, goals are thought to be an explicit expression of one&rsquo;s desires and life values. It follows that we are fully aware of what is truly important to us and that it&rsquo;s possible to translate our priorities into conscious plans. However, I personally find a significant disconnect between conscious thought and implicit life values. It&rsquo;s difficult to crystallize the  value &ldquo;compass&rdquo; in words. Plans that come out of a rational mind can be in conflict with  governing values.</p>

<p>I have a personal illustration. I have never put the relationship with my wife as a priority or in any of the goals. However, in moments of distress I have dropped everything to take care of her. None of the goals mattered in that instant. I realize now just how important she is for me. Consciously, I did not rank the relationship high in my list of priorities and goals. But subconsciously I knew what is going to rule my behavior, especially in times of difficulty.</p>

<p>Secondly, goals have costs. It is one thing to write goals down. It is another to accept sacrifices that might be required to make them happen. I&rsquo;ve heard complaints about lines of work that are not terribly exciting. Along the complaints came aspirations for entrepreneurship and exhilarating work at emerging start-ups. I confess that the thought is contagious. I entertained it myself. But then I realized that this change has a cost and that I highly value what I already have.</p>

<p>Taken together, these two factors are responsible for destroying many naive goal setting efforts. Symptoms may differ but at the core the problem is that goals simply don&rsquo;t truly matter to the person setting them. It won&rsquo;t help to break down a goal into smaller goals or to have regular progress reviews. It just doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>

<p>I often recall an episode when I was about 10 years old. Two of my friends were coached by their parents to think about their lives and set goals and do all sorts of ridiculous &ldquo;self development&rdquo; exercises. I haven&rsquo;t done any of that. Yet all of the things I appreciate this very day did not come out of any priority list.</p>

<p>I believe there is a place for planning but life is not one of them. I see goals useful when an issue is well understood. Setting goals to win a specific sports competition is a technical matter. On the other hand, setting a goal to enter a competition in the first place is an entirely different thing.</p>

<p>My resolution for this NY is to stop doing useless bullshit personal goal setting crap.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The weather on weekends has been excellent lately. On December 8th me and my friend John went for a snowshoe hike close to Braunwald.</p>

<p>It was so warm that we took off our jackets.</p>

<p>The hike took about 4 hours. There&rsquo;s plenty of snow and we got our snowshoes on in about 35 minutes after beginning the trek.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finding good sources of information is similar to finding a good diet &mdash; there is an overwhelming amount of stuff available (abundance of calories) but the utility (healthiness) of it is close to zero. Many news outlets and online media have incentives that are in conflict with providing thoughtful quality material. Media chases advertisements. In the race to achieve highest numbers of visits and ad impressions it shamelessly bombards us readers with juicy junk articles with loud headlines that shamelessly grab our attention. These articles give a quick gratification but in the long-term rob us of thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see an immediate solution that works for the whole society. However, that does not preclude me from avoiding the poison altogether. I intentionally avoid mainstream news. I don&rsquo;t get sucked into politics and my perception of the world is not skewed by the over representation of certain topics (such as airplane crashes). I don&rsquo;t blindly follow industry news either. There are lots of new tools, frameworks and gadgets coming out every day. It&rsquo;s impossible to learn everything so I prefer to focus on lasting ideas and skills. I can pick-up and learn ephemeral details whenever I have a specific task at hand.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t passively follow what is currently trending or popular. Instead, I actively seeks news through a curated list of blogs and news sources. Even with a curated list I had problems getting overwhelmed with too many items. A low signal to noise ratio takes a lot of effort to deal with.</p>

<p>From now on I will maintain an updated list of RSS feeds of blogs and websites that I am subscribed to on the <a href="http://drseergio.github.io/news-sources">News sources</a> page.</p>

    <updated>2013-11-25T21:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2013/11/25/doing-it-my-way</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a habit of regularly reading books that are of pseudo spiritual and self help and personal growth nature. I did not follow their contents word for word but I believed I could glean useful solutions to life problems and new ways to think about reality. Recently, I came to a conclusion that I&rsquo;m not going to read such books anymore. No more productivity books. No more books on settings goals. No more books on personal growth.</p>

<p>At the core of my discontent is a realization that every person exists within a unique set of circumstances. The set of circumstances benefits from a matching set of solutions. Solutions could be anything from spiritual beliefs and value systems to productivity habits and strategies. Whenever a person observes himself succeeding in light of his actions he entrenches in conviction that his discoveries are universal.</p>

<p>I have a problem with this premise. Even in relatively similar environments every person is shaped by an intersection of local influences, actions, ideas, challenges and opportunities. I don&rsquo;t believe there are universal truths as to how to run distinctive lives. Trying to blindly follow someone else&rsquo;s beliefs is akin to dull imitation. In addition, the result is likely to be irrelevant and misplaced.</p>

<p>Most of the self help literature builds upon anecdotes &mdash; stories of highly successful people (I&rsquo;m talking about success in its widest meaning, anything between spiritual enlightenment and lucrative business empire). Authors conveniently escape talking about failures and millions of interrelated things that contribute to extraordinary outcomes. I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s possible to extract specific traits or behaviors that guarantee success. Some highly successful people are punctual. Others never gave shit about being organized yet are arguably in the same success &ldquo;league&rdquo;.</p>

<p>After all the hours spent on reading these books I&rsquo;ve embraced introspection as an alternative tool. Instead of looking outwards to find solutions I look into myself to understand what challenges I face, what is important, what brings happiness and joy. I also take a moment to appreciate what I already have.</p>

<p>See what I have done here? Exactly what the self help literature does. I&rsquo;ve imposed personal experience to provide seemingly helpful guidance. The problem is that this &ldquo;guidance&rdquo; builds upon my perception and a set of beliefs that are likely to be very different from yours. Maybe if I&rsquo;ve never read any of the self help books my stance would be different. Perhaps you should read all the self help books you can and come to the same conclusion independently.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s anything to take away then it&rsquo;s that it helps to be critical when reading other people&rsquo;s ideas.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been sick in and out with all kinds of cold during past several weeks. I had a lucky break last weekend and went for a snowshoe hike in Arosa, Switzerland.</p>

<p>It has been the first time I&rsquo;ve taken the snowshoes on. I had a misconception that snowshoes will let you float on the surface. They won&rsquo;t. After a couple of hours I got a hang of it and could even run. I know I&rsquo;ll be spending time outdoors so I splurged on luxurious MSR ascent snowshoes. These snowshoes have good grip &ndash; I could not slide even if I wanted to.</p>

<p>The hike itself has been rather easy and there was not much snow. However, it has been a good opportunity to get used to the snowshoes.</p>

<p>We have spent the day bathing in sun above a fog that covered most of central Switzerland. On our way back there was a 2 minute opportunity to shoot the fog and the sunset before descending back into fog&rsquo;s vast but short-lived kingdom (we were changing train to bus as the regular train route was blocked by a rockfall).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Via ferratas come in different difficulty levels. Last week I&rsquo;ve done a K2 climb. Yesterday I went to Fuerenalp along with two friends and did a K4 climb. The route is a lot more exciting. Wet and slippery stones and supports presented an additional challenge.</p>

<p>According the alpine log book there were no other climbers that day.</p>

    <link href="http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2013/10/30/investment-portfolio-update-october-2013/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-30T19:28:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2013/10/30/investment-portfolio-update-october-2013</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Investments are a cornerstone for building passive income, increasing wealth and eventually reaching financial independence. I have passion for learning how the investment world functions and what are the different trading strategies. For the past 4 years I have mostly relied on low-cost index investments and company stock in distressed industries. In addition, I have had lots of interest towards quantitative strategies.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago I have faced a possibility of a major change in life so I have liquidated every investment into cash in preparation for it. The change never came. After reflecting upon my limited trading experience I have realized that I don&rsquo;t have a coherent strategy and I am likely to fall for the many biases and traps, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Confirmation bias. Unless I&rsquo;m doing trading (real or on paper) my brain is likely to pick-up just the positive examples of an investment strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>No single coherent idea or strategy. I have been fascinated by many tools, strategies and approaches. I have spent many hours translating ideas or systems in code that I can run to verify results. When I am chasing so many options I never arrive at anything satisfying and conclusive.</p></li>
<li><p>Not believing into one&rsquo;s own approach. Somewhat related to the previous point. Unless I&rsquo;m confident in a chosen strategy I am likely not to invest timely. This means I miss many gains and lose more often because I pull out prematurely.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of free quality market data. Together with a friend I have written a convoluted system to buy and sell company stock around major price shocks. The system demonstrated fantastic results. However, I have realized that the price data does not include companies that went bankrupt. Such omissions make back-testing overly optimistic.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of desire to dedicate lots of time. I won&rsquo;t last forever and I want to use the opportunity to live my life fully. There is unlimited amount of market information to understand and make use of. Onwards, I consciously choose not to spend all my spare time on investments.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Investment strategy of choice</h3>

<p>To overcome the concerns I have made a decision to consistently follow a strategy that I accept consciously and intellectually. The strategy is called &ldquo;Ivy Portfolio&rdquo;. There are several variations of this strategy and it boils down to holding about 5 diversified instruments when their prices are above a certain threshold. I recommend reading resources I&rsquo;ve linked to at the bottom of this post.</p>

<p>What appeals to me in this strategy is its simplicity and ability to reduce draw-downs in down markets. I will allocate 80% of my portfolio in Ivy Portfolio. The rest is going to be invested in individual companies and experimental quantitative strategies.</p>

<p>Once a month I will spend about 2-6 hours on maintaining my investment portfolio and sharing findings on this site. I will calculate and update signals for the past month, aggregate quarterly performance figures, test alternative strategies and publish results. I consciously impose a limit so that I don&rsquo;t end-up aimlessly procrastinating. I will need to set clear goals and boundaries if I want to fit in the limits.</p>

<h3>Strategy details</h3>

<p>There are several variations of the Ivy Portfolio strategy. The one that appeals to me is called &ldquo;TOP 3 GTAA 13&rdquo;. First, one needs to choose 13 instruments that represent different kinds of assets. I have made a choice of the following instruments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>VTV</strong> &ndash; Vanguard Value ETF (US Large Cap Value)</li>
<li><strong>MTUM</strong> &ndash; iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor (US Large Cap Momentum)</li>
<li><strong>VBR</strong> &ndash; Vanguard Small Cap Value ETF (US Small Cap Value)</li>
<li><strong>VBK</strong> &ndash; Vanguard Small Cap Growth ETF (US Small Cap Momentum)</li>
<li><strong>VEA</strong> &ndash; Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (Foreign Developed)</li>
<li><strong>VWO</strong> &ndash; Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (Foreign Emerging)</li>

<p>The goal is to find representative ETFs with lowest expenses and higher liquidity. On the last trading day of a month performance of each instrument is compared. 3 best performing instruments are bought. The cycle is repeated every month. Portfolio is rebalanced to maintain correct ratios.</p>

<p>It does not matter what tool you use to calculate the results. I prefer R so I have written few functions to do the calculation for me. I present the code below. I assume you have R installed along with the &ldquo;quantmod&rdquo; package. By default, quantmod relies on Yahoo! Finance as the source for price data.</p>

<p>* Instruments that have insufficient data are penalized with large negative returns.</p>

<p>** Ideally the analysis must be performed at the close of the last trading day of the month, however, due to personal reasons this won&rsquo;t be possible every month. This is also why I do it today, rather than on 2013-10-31.</p>

    <updated>2013-10-27T19:51:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2013/10/27/the-photo-curse</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am fascinated with photography. A picture inspires, tells a story, expresses an author&rsquo;s view, captures a fleeting moment, gives an aesthetic pleasure. But there&rsquo;s a way to kill inspiration and make this art forever painful for oneself.</p>

<p>Ever since I&rsquo;ve purchased my own digital camera 4 years ago I&rsquo;ve been both blessed and burdened by photography. I have even purposefully abstained from taking any pictures for at least a couple of lengthy periods. Recently I had breakthroughs that have completely changed my attitude and brought the fun back!</p>

<p>At the root of most of my photography problems was an internal conflict between two seemingly contradicting ideas: &ldquo;enjoy the moment&rdquo; or &ldquo;take a photograph&rdquo;. One part of me badly wanted to take the camera out and put it on a tripod to take a shot. The other part was thoroughly disgusted at the sight of tourists pushing each other just to take an unremarkable shot of themselves. This other part of me reminded me not to become a mindless photo zombie machine. It&rsquo;s a common sight to see anxious visitors snap a landmark and then almost immediately move on to something else. I have seen the culmination at the Louvre museum in Paris where dozens of people are trying to take a picture of Mona Lisa. It&rsquo;s ridiculous. Why go to places at all if you don&rsquo;t genuinely marvel at things? That&rsquo;s why I often prefer to stop and really &ldquo;taste&rdquo; a sight.</p>

<p>Getting a sense of satisfaction from a photograph goes a long way. Realistically, nobody cares about my photos. There are just too many great and amazing photographers out there. Without full-time dedication it is not <em>likely</em> that anyone will become a true artist. I don&rsquo;t aspire to become one. I do photographs as a hobby and I seek satisfaction from my work regardless of how many people will ever see my photographs. But even with a very limited audience presentation is important. Everyone occasionally makes amazing photographs but the problem is that those pictures get mixed with the rest and lose their charm. For example, after a journey I end-up with 3 truly amazing shots and 40 good shots (lets say out of 500 total). It&rsquo;s better to separate pictures in sets and present amazing shots individually.</p>

<p>Then there is the feeling of being overwhelmed with options. There are unlimited number of things you can do to a photograph, not even counting limitless possibilities of composition and exposure. You can retouch a portrait, merge multiple photos together, apply various post processing effects and adjustments. Not surprisingly, this sea of options caused me almost an infinite hesitation. Should make a black-and-white picture? Or duo-tone? Or use crazy colors?</p>

<p>The problem with too many options goes beyond software. Hardware. I own two cameras, three lenses and an assortment of accessories (such as tripods, filters, etc). Carrying too much stuff gave me (head)ache for two reasons: hard to decide what lens/setup to use right now and the practical inconvenience of lugging too much stuff around. That&rsquo;s why now I mostly use a mirrorless camera with a fixed lens. For every occasion I now think ahead of what kind of shots I am after. Limits are good for fueling creativity.</p>

<p>The advent of digital cameras meant that nobody was bound by the limit of 36 frames anymore. The down-side is the actual upside. Instead of having 36 or so pictures one can easily end-up with thousands. It is a chore to go through all these pictures. Even worse, without a usable storage scheme/structure it is virtually impossible to navigate through one&rsquo;s own photos. I went through 3 iterations before I arrived at a system that works reasonably well. I&rsquo;ll explain it in a separate post.</p>

<p>Finally, it is the time pressure that exacerbates everything I have mentioned above. Going to an event or a trip with other people means that others expect to see pictures. Of course it&rsquo;s possible to ignore them and not touch the pictures for more than a year. I&rsquo;ve done that so many times! Obviously, postponing means that the backlog of pictures will grow to thousands (if not tens of thousands) of pictures. At some point there is a mounting pressure to get over the past photos before touching anything recent. It&rsquo;s a down-spiral from here. Why take pictures if I have not touched any from the past year?</p>

<p>The breakthrough that has helped me overcome problems is simple. I&rsquo;ve asked myself what kind of pictures I am taking and why. Depending on the answer I plan accordingly. I keep two major categories in my mind: photos for reporting and photos for pleasure.</p>

<p>The reporting pictures ideally take little to none processing and are mostly for documenting journeys and moments. Rules of good composition still apply but I would not plan on doing black-on-white shots or time-consuming post-processing effects. I keep these photographs as simple as possible. This allows me to share pictures most people care about quickly.</p>

<p>The other kind of photos is for joyous purposes. That includes interesting shooting angles, time-lapses, stitched panoramas, HDR shots and all kinds of fancy processing in software.</p>

<p>The important part is to separate photos into these categories as soon as possible. Then there is no pressure to finish everything at once. I find that having a separate backlog for artistic photos motivating. I return to individual photos and spend time experimenting without pressure. I feel a lot more creative and liberated that way.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This Saturday I had a pleasure to do my first &ldquo;via ferrata&rdquo; climb in Switzerland, in Pinut to be precise. Via ferrata routes do not require climbing experience. The idea is to climb up a mountain and various obstacles while being hooked-up to a metal cable that runs along the whole route. Equipment-wise prospective climbers need a harness, a via ferrata set (a Y-shaped lanyard with an energy absorber) and a helmet.</p>

<p>The weather was phenomenally good for late October. Air temperature has risen to almost 20C! Possibly, this has been the last day of the year in Switzerland to do such a climb. I&rsquo;ll be happy to do more via ferrata climbs next year &ndash; there are hundreds of routes throughout the country.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I honestly would not anticipate writing about Microsoft Windows. Not after I have irrevocably and irreversibly switched to Linux and OSX years ago when I was studying at the university.</p>

<p>But here I am, happily typing this in Sublime2 editor on my desktop computer running nothing else but Microsoft Windows 8. Yes, the same computer that had been running Gentoo Linux a week or so ago!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Long story short I&rsquo;ve never intended this to happen. My goal was to reduce number of gadgets. Instead of a full-size tower PC and an Apple MacMini I wanted a single powerful machine running OSX. My idea was to buy a new motherboard with Thunderbolt ports (to connect two 27&#8221; Apple displays) and install OSX on to it. It&rsquo;s not an officially supported thing to do but I could not care less. The upcoming Apple MacPro is going to cost a fortune anyway and there is absolutely no way for me to justify such a steep price.</p>

<p><a href="http://drseergio.github.io/images/win8/3.jpg"><img src="http://drseergio.github.io/images/win8/3_s.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>As you probably expect things did not go according to plan. It turned out that the motherboard I have ordered includes a Thunderbolt controller (DSL4510/4410) that is not yet supported by OSX (not even the latest Mavericks version). That left any attempts to install OSX out in the cold.</p>

<p><a href="http://drseergio.github.io/images/win8/9.jpg"><img src="http://drseergio.github.io/images/win8/9_s.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>The reason I had an Apple computer in the first place was to natively run software that does not exist on Linux, such as Adobe imaging products. So I&rsquo;ve decided to install Windows and use all the same software on it. After all, the hardware I had put together has &ldquo;designed for Windows 8&rdquo; written all over it.</p>

<p>I was expecting a miserable experience. People love to bash Microsoft Windows and there are reasons for that. However, I found that the desktop experience works rather well and looks good. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t see much difference between operating systems for desktop work-loads because most of the time I use a web browser. Windows 8 does not stand in my way.</p>

<p>Every system has its quirks and Windows is no exception. I am used to quirks in all of the systems I have a pleasure to work with. The things I did not like about Windows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Installing drivers. In OSX almost everything is built-in. In Linux you either have a distribution with a binary kernel that includes support for almost every device or, if you&rsquo;re into it, you compile your own. Neither OSX nor Linux mandate messing with device support unless you really want to.</p></li>
<li><p>Updates. The dreadful updates plague OSX as well but not as much as Windows. I don&rsquo;t fully appreciate forced reboots and long installation times.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of virtual desktops. Even with two 27&#8221; screens I like to have an option to switch to a different work-space. Both OSX and Linux have nailed this well. I&rsquo;ve found a program that enables virtual desktop but I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s doing its work efficiently. Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t care because the Intel i7 4740K is very fast and there&rsquo;s 16GB of system memory available.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of good terminal. As a work-around I&rsquo;ve installed Console2 and Cygwin. It&rsquo;s an OK solution. I also SSH into a powerful Linux server (which acts as a <a href="http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2013/09/01/htpc-build-i-slash-m-proud-of/">HTPC</a> ) and keep a bunch of VMs around.</p></li>
<li><p>Sleep puts all windows on one monitor. In addition, the time is not immediately synced so I see the time when the computer was put to sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Smaller behavior quirks that are solved by finding and installing utilities. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>AltDrag to drag windows with a pointer while holding Alt pressed</li>
<li>AlwaysMouseWheel to scroll windows that are not in focus</li>
<li>TypeIt to enter German characters with a QWERTY layout</li>
<li>Dexpot for virtual desktops</li>
<li>ObjectDock for a OSX-like bar</li>
<li>ClipX as a clipboard history manager</li>
<li>NO, I do not need a &ldquo;start menu&rdquo; :D</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>The machine is exquisite! It&rsquo;s extremely quiet &ndash; it has only a single 120mm fan on the CPU heat-sink (I removed all the other fans). There are no extension cards and everything else is cooled passively. There&rsquo;s just one SSD and no vibrating hard disks. I can&rsquo;t tell if the computer is running or not! The Apple screens are gorgeous. I&rsquo;ve added a Logitech trackpad to do the touch gestures.</p>

<p><a href="http://drseergio.github.io/images/win8/4.jpg"><img src="http://drseergio.github.io/images/win8/4_s.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>While I believe OSX might eventually support the Thunderbolt controller I don&rsquo;t plan to switch. The desktop experience is great and all the software I need works well. I&rsquo;ve sold all the gadgets, computers and computer parts I wanted through a local online auction. I feel much better now!</p>

<p>Full hardware list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Antec 1200 case (with all fans either removed or disabled)</li>
<li>Asus Z87 deluxe/dual motherboard</li>
<li>Intel 4770K</li>
<li>Noctua NH-U12P SE2 cooler</li>
<li>2x8GB RAM</li>
<li>Apple Cinema Display 27&#8221;</li>
<li>Apple Thunderbolt Screen 27&#8221;</li>
<li>Advantage Kinesis keyboard</li>
<li>Logitech M570 trackball</li>
<li>Logitech T650 multi-touch trackpad</li>
<li>Seasonic 460W passively-cooled PSU</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2013/10/21/why-write-at-all/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-21T18:39:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2013/10/21/why-write-at-all</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago I have deactivated my Facebook account. I&rsquo;ve been intending to do that for months. Finally, I&rsquo;ve left the service for good.</p>

<p>Looking all the way back to 2006 I don&rsquo;t have much to show for it. You can&rsquo;t call me an addict because I&rsquo;ve never been hooked as much as people around me. Nevertheless, whenever I had cared to open Facebook&rsquo;s trendy blue interface I have been bombarded with meaningless status updates and viral junk. Numerous pointless apps and games just intensified the noise.</p>

<p>The noise itself never bothered me that much. What really bothered me is the dismal quality of what users share. It&rsquo;s seems to be a common problem with all social media. Most users simply don&rsquo;t share anything worth anyone else&rsquo;s attention. Instead of sharing genuine experiences, reflecting on one&rsquo;s life or authoring insightful writing I&rsquo;ve seen boasting, junk videos, cynicism, meaningless quotes and cryptic posts. Combined, these make their authors feel special and invite pointless discussions.</p>

<p>Facebook always made me feel bad about myself or my life. Other people&rsquo;s experiences seem just so much more authentic and full of life. It&rsquo;s basically like trashy advertising that shows you happy folks cleaning toilets with a certain kind of solvent. But instead of random folks you see whoever you had added to your Facebook &ldquo;friends&rdquo; and instead of cleaning toilets you see them doing whatever is that they were doing.</p>

<p>There are ways to read the &ldquo;stream&rdquo; without feeling insecure and unsatisfied. But it&rsquo;s hard mental and spiritual work. Despite spending considerable time to embrace mindful and present living I find Facebook to be a tough opponent. Facebook pierces through peace like a full metal jacket bullet. It&rsquo;s better to let go and give it up altogether.</p>

<p>Generally, I like the premise of a social network like Facebook. In theory it could be great. Imagine having a close circle of people who exert an effort to distill and publish their thoughts. Imagine a circle of friends who take the time to break down their adventures and experiences into stories. I am in total awe when a person cares to think and write down her thoughts instead of just slapping a bunch of photos in my face. Even if a story is not very coherent or deep.</p>

<p>I understand why Facebook, or any social media for that matter, is like that. It&rsquo;s easier to write and share junk. It&rsquo;s our brains wired for infinite satisfaction. A collection of juicy and emotional posts trigger our long-forgotten instincts just like an unhealthy sugary/fatty meal does. Nobody voluntarily wants to spend time writing or reading long posts when a &ldquo;Wall&rdquo; is bursting with sugar-high gossip, funny and disgusting media. One must willingly overcome animal desires and instincts. Choose a high-value diet &ndash; provoking and challenging information sources.</p>

<p>Not to seem like a hypocrite but I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve shared much in a meaningful way myself. I have not shared much at all. I intend to change with this personal home page. It&rsquo;s far from being a first blog of mine &ndash; there were many before it. For me the hardest part in keeping a personal page is finding a meaningful reason to share. It&rsquo;s all to easy to make a blog nothing else but a collection of the same crappy posts you see in social networks. The reason I think it&rsquo;s different this time is I feel no rush. I enjoy reflecting and writing down thoughts. I truly don&rsquo;t care if there is no value in these musings. I truly enjoy doing it right now.</p>

<p>Hopefully, by some serendipitous encounter you will find this site and share either thoughts or values or hobbies with me. Although even less likely, I hope we meet and do something fun together!</p>

    <id>http://drseergio.github.io/blog/2013/09/08/my-lucky-night-with-freenas-failure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s 1:35am right now and something really bad has happened about 4 hours ago. First, Time Machine on my Mac Mini complained that the backup network disk became inaccessible. Then network shares have stopped responding on all computers. This means something wrong has happened with the wonderful reliable NAS server that I had built weeks ago.</p>

<p>First, I connect to the server via SSH and start poking around. Once I notice that file-system commands, such as <code>ls</code>, cause sessions to hang I become worrisome. I do a reboot hoping that solves the problem. 10 minutes pass. The server does not start.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right" src="http://drseergio.github.io/images/chinese_monitor.jpg"></p>

<p>Once I&rsquo;ve connected a handy <a href="http://dx.com/p/8-tft-lcd-car-reverse-rear-view-color-monitor-w-vga-bnc-cable-black-149114">8&#8221; VGA monitor</a> I noticed SCSI driver related problems in the kernel logs. As it turns out, the USB drive on which FreeNAS had been installed has failed. This monitor is really handy for troubleshooting problems with servers &ndash; small, easy to carry and occupies little space in the toolbox. The picture quality is god-awful but good enough for reading terminal output.</p>

<p>I have been expecting the worst &ndash; that I would need to re-configure everything. After a quick search on the Internet I found out that FreeNAS keeps configuration in a SQLite database file on the 4th partition in <code>freenas-v1.db</code> file. A bleak hope ran through my mind. I&rsquo;ve connected the flash disk to a Linux computer and started poking around. All I needed to do was to compile UFS file-system support in kernel and then mount the partition with:</p>

<p><code>mount -r -t ufs -o ufstype=44bsd /dev/sdc4 /tmp/mm</code></p>

<p>I copied the file over and verified that it&rsquo;s not corrupted. YES! I had been stupidly postponing back-up of the configuration file. If I had to re-configure FreeNAS from scratch I would feel like a fool and waste a week worth of evenings. Now, I just need to burn the FreeNAS image to a replacement drive and I&rsquo;m all set.</p>

<p>The last step took embarassingly long time. None of the images that I had written either on Linux or Mac would boot. FreeNAS would get to an error saying <code>corrupt or invalid GPT detected.</code>. No matter what I did the outcome was the same. The solution was to delete GPT by running parted from Linux and doing <code>mklabel msdos</code>, followed by write of the disk image. I believe this problem occurred because I had previously used the drives for experimentation with Chromebook and some GPT headers apparently remained there.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://drseergio.github.io/images/msata.jpg"></p>

<p>Finally, I found a spare mSATA SSD drive lying around with no use (a leftover from a notebook upgrade). I also had a mSATA adapter so I&rsquo;ve put them together inside of the NAS to use as a boot device for FreeNAS. Now the NAS has 8 SATA devices (6 HDDs and 2 SSDs) maxing out all available SATA ports in the system.</p>

<p>Once I have successfully booted the server and got to the web UI and initiated import of the recovered configuration database file. Then the server rebooted twice and everything was back!</p>

<p>The machine is back online and running beautifully. I now have a backup of the configuration. In case anything goes wrong again reinstalling FreeNAS is really quick &amp; simple IFF the backup configuration file is available. I am once again pleasantly surprised at how well FreeNAS is made.</p>
